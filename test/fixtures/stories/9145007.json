The app I'm building has some really complex interactions that involve building a \"mini\" language within the app. For example:` \u003csend me an email\u003e    \u003cif I get a tweet from @whatever\u003e \u003celse\u003e    \u003ccompile all mentions into one email\u003e `^ It's something like IFTT meets the simplicity of a markup language. So the user would actually be able to define these workflows much like writing simple jquery.\n\nThere's more to it than that but as you can see it extends far beyond basic iOS application building.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"ryanSrich","submitted":"2 hours ago","parent_id":9146369},{"story_id":9145007,"id":9147081,"is_dead":false,"body":"I think if you have an interesting problem it's easier to get a developer on board than if you have something thats a lot of work but tedious to do.Also I always offer 50/50 split after I have recouped my investment.

One could argue that ghostnote might or might have a potential for $50k but who knows? Add the fact that some gurus say paid apps are dead while you can find numerous paid ones working fine, it is just confusing.Then there is decision on pricing the app. I was reading up on some devs who put out their income figures. One might be inclined to think Dash for iOS at $10 might be a hard sell but it has done really good. On comparing to another app priced at $3.99 with same number of downloads, the returns have been much higher.So the issue doesn't stop with whether I can make it back.
