Two years after you accept this offer, the company gets acquired for tens of millions of dollars without taking any new funding. This is great! You can exercise your options for a tiny amount, and they are worth a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince you’ve been there for 2 years, half of your options are vested. No one can take those away from you. But what happens to the other half?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe acquirer—your new boss—comes to you and says that the remaining half of your options are gone. If you want to keep your job, you have to sign a new equity agreement which won’t make you nearly as much money and comes with a new 4 year vesting schedule that starts today. Can they do that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eYour company’s option plan\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe answer depends on your company’s option plan—most often called an equity incentive plan. Your company has one of these to govern all options granted to employees. If you don’t have a copy, get one from whoever handles HR at your company.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s what you’re looking for. From Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson’s \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalist/dp/1118443616\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVenture Deals\u003c/a\u003e in the section “Assumption of Options”: “Most contemporary option plans have provisions whereby all granted options fully vest immediately prior to an acquisition should the plan and/or options underneath the plan not be assumed by the buyer.” An example of what this provision looks like is at the bottom of this post.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis standard provision is good for you. It means that the acquirer has a few options: (1) keep your same option agreement in place—same exercise price, same number of shares, same vesting, (2) replace your option agreement using the acquirer’s stock in a way that is no worse to you in terms of total payout and vesting schedule, or (3) let you exercise all your vested and unvested options now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn short, you’ll be in at least as good a position after the acquisition as you were before it. (But note this doesn’t mean everything will be perfect. If the acquirer decides that you are no longer needed, they could keep your option agreement intact and terminate your employment. You wouldn’t get any further vesting unless you have single-trigger or double-trigger acceleration, and you’d be out of a job. It would be the same as if you’d been fired by your company before the acquisition.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eTimes are changing\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that some acquirers and investors are trying to change this. They want option plans to say that there is no vesting acceleration regardless of whether the acquirer assumes the option plan. This means that the acquirer can simply cancel any unvested options and offer you whatever equity compensation they want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few Bay Area serial acquirers are pushing for this. It allows them to structure retention packages for their new employees in any way they see fit. Some investors also like it because cancelled options mean they get more of the payout. (To be fair, all shareholders including founders get more of the payout.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePERSONAL OPINION ALERT: This new trend is BS. Employee and company agreed to a deal. That deal is being pulled away by the acquirer in a way that the employee probably never knew possible. Most employees have never even seen their option plan. As a founder, I’d feel incredibly sleazy about having this type of landmine hidden away in the option plan. By keeping to the standard option plan language, acquirers have a much harder time forcing bad deals down their new employees’ throats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe situation that is most likely to lead to problems is if the acquirer wants to keep an employee but at reduced equity compensation. Full acceleration means the acquirer can’t force a much less lucrative deal on the employee by saying they’ll be out of a job if they don’t accept the new deal. It instead forces the acquirer to honor the existing option agreement if they believe the employee is valuable. It changes the starting point of the negotiation between employee and their new boss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eConclusion\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour option plan should give you full acceleration if an acquirer does not assume the company’s option plan (or replace it with an equivalent plan). If you don’t have that, it is worth thinking through how it could be used against you. This is especially true if you are likely to have a lot of unvested options when your company gets acquired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eSample provision regarding assumption of option plan\u003c/i\u003e.\u0026nbsp;This is a long, complicated provision.

The employee then purchases those shares from us in line with a vesting agreement. All warrants and conversions are exactly the same as the founders shares.This means that they pay tax on this purchase as regular income rather than capital gains up front with the money we give them for it. This prevents a heavy tax bill at conversion and allows them to retain their vested shares regardless of if they work for us or not after the first 12 month vesting period.We calculated that the up front taxes are magnitudes cheaper in the long run because the increased valuation will cover those differences handily and there is no waiting period like there is with capital gains tax.\n\nIn the end though our intention was to make a simple way for our employees to actually own the stock we give them as compensation and it not be something that they can lose or be restructured easily.

The major issues are probably:1. Acceleration on change of control (the article covers this). 1 year acceleration is fairly common it seems. There should be something here. But fully acceleration of granted options is probably more than you realistically can hope for. After all, you didn't need to work for that year to get the options. There should be some balance here.2. Rule 83b electoins. Particularly relevant for pre-funding startups and especially for founders. It allows you to pay all the tax on options up front rather than be hit by yearly AMT bills;3. Clawback agreements. This is a nasty one that was most publicly brought to light with Skype (the second time around). A bunch of executives were fired before the acquisition went through, allegedly for performance reasons. Their options could be bought back at issue price, resulting in a windfall for SilverLake of possibly several hundred million. Want to sue? Well the company was incorporated overseas. Good luck with that.The moral of the story is watch out for any rights the company has to repurchase your options and at what price.Repurchases in general aren't necessarily evil. It's good to avoid having a lot of shareholders for early stage companies (due to SEC limits on number of shareholders for non-public companies) but such repurchases need to be fair.4. You're taxed on options based on their fair market value when they're issued barring a Rule 83b election;5. Liquidation preferences. VCs generally have some form of preferential treatment on how they're repaid in the event of a buyout. This can take a number of forms.The most reasonable is that they're simply guaranteed to get their money back. Meaning if they paid $10M for a 40% stake in a company that gets bought for $15M they're going to get their $10M back instead of 40% * $15M = $6M. That's not unreasonable.But what's not reasonable (IMHO) is \"participating preferred\" liquidation preferences. What this means in the above scenario is the VC will get $10M of the $15M back and then 40% of the remaining $5M. So the other 60% are divvying up $3M. That's a lot less attractive.6. Bonuses in lieu of acquisition. You may see a headline that says your company has been bought for $100M and you own 1%. Great! You're now a millionaire! Not so fast...It may turn out the VC owns 40% participating preferred with $20M funding and the company is actually only being bought for $50M. The other $50M is incentives in the new company paid to the founders and possibly key executives.So you're only getting 1% of $30M.7. Dilution. Your 1% may not be 1%. You may have been told something like \"there are 1M shares outstanding and we're granting you 10,000 options over 4 years with 1 year cliff\". So you own 1% right? Well, maybe you do and maybe you don't.The company may be reporting outstanding shares rather than outstanding shares plus any obligations it's made. It really needs to report on a fully diluted basis. There may be convertible notes and rights of existing VCs to buy in in future funding rounds, etc.\n\nSo anyway there are a lot of potential traps.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"cletus","submitted":"1 hour ago","parent_id":null},{"story_id":9145126,"id":9147413,"is_dead":false,"body":"And what do I do if they use #2?

Just because it worked well for you in one situation does not mean that it will work out in all scenarios.The reason that companies sometimes don't disclose this information is that when you state ownership as a % it can seem minuscule emotionally. Anything less than 1% just doesn't seem like much even if it actually it.\n\nThat being said I don't think this is a good enough reason.
