Since then, I’ve severely changed my lifestyle and reduced my living costs to a crazy low figure and worked my ass off for the last 8 months to achieve this:\n\nwww.openloopz.com\n\nI have written more about it on Medium here: http://goo.gl/JN03yf\n\nI knew from the start the odds were stacked against me. I’m almost 36, I have a family and I live in the North East of England where - without wanting to sound negative - the opportunities are few and far between compared to what I see on here.  When I made the BETA announcement, I knew no-one would just magically sign-up, but I watched and waited anyway and became extremely pissed off when it didn’t happen. “It’s been 2 hours - why haven’t I got 100 sign-ups already?”.  Silly really.\n\nI used up all my savings to get this far and I don’t regret any of it (except maybe the weight gain, lack of a social life, and development of bad sleeping habits!). I wanted to prove to myself I can build a production quality app that I honestly believe in without bias, and I can truly say I have achieved that now.\n\nBut now comes the hard part.  I need to force myself to stop coding and start actually talking about OpenLoopz and trying to spread the word. I am the first to admit I am not very good at this. I am struggling to even write this post because I already know that probably no-one will read it.  But I just have to learn to get over that and keep going. Any feedback - good or bad - will be greatly appreciated, thanks.","points":313,"submitted":"8 hours ago","submitter":"pdrummond","comments_count":136},"article":null,"comments":[{"story_id":9144271,"id":9144420,"is_dead":false,"body":"On first glance, the marketing site is clean, tidy, and professional.

I'll try out the app today as well. I'm in a similar position with you as well (i.e. family, closer to 30s) so I very well know what you're going through.You've just pointed out that now comes the part about communicating what OpenLoopz is all about. Once you've done that well, you'll see the beta sign-ups come through. They may not necessarily buy from you just yet but keep in touch with them and learn from their user interactions to improve the product.One of the hardest things is landing the very first customer. But it's not impossible. Good luck!My early thoughts: Based on the website, it's not fully clear what OpenLoopz does and how it does it (i.e. How will it make me communicate better and get things done quicker?). You got me somewhat hooked on \"communicate better and get things done quicker\" so now, tell me can I achieve it with your app. Since a \"Loop\" is a new concept, you'll need to explain it but keep it subtle - as a user, my point is to communicate better and get things done quicker. If a \"Loop\" helps me do it, great. If not, I'm not really interested in what a \"Loop\" is.\n\nI'd focus on trying to serve 1 customer segment at the moment. Having multiple price packages for multiple customer segments will be tough to serve because all their needs and demands will be quite different.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"tixocloud","submitted":"8 hours ago","parent_id":null},{"story_id":9144271,"id":9144525,"is_dead":false,"body":"Just a note: if you go to http://openloopz.com (no \"www\") it displays \"Heroku | No such app\".

Your website is useless for promoting your product.  I don't like the headline font for your site, the lack of screenshots, basically the lack of focus on a product that will live or die on its usability and interface.   I'm not a fan of the Z in openloopz.  Combined with the comic sansy looking headline font it doesn't feel polished.The inventing of a new words (\"loops\") is to be avoided unless absolutely necessary.  You are now not only trying to tell a (very) mildly interested reader about your product you need them to learn a new language in order to understand it.  This is an unrealistic cognitive burden for a sales pitch for a todo app.  I strongly suggest that you use the simplest possible terms in plain language to describe the focus of your product, how it fits into the users life, and what problems it solves for them.Your post here is more focused on your personal suffering than on your product.  We are all eating shit to try to launch our companies, but too much focus on that makes for a downer intro to your product.  I'd try to separate your moments of sharing the struggle and the moments of sharing the product.  Do you want people to be genuinely excited about it, or pity you?  Which emotion do you want to be a stronger first response?Scanning further over your medium article (It's longer than a casual browser will give it time, ie 5 seconds) I suggest you take whatever the salient feature of your product is, maybe the hashtagging to create inline tasks and put that front and center in a huge picture and font.  I'm still not sure what problem you are solving or who you are competing with, is it todo lists, slack, what?  Where does this tool fit in my life?   I suggest you take a look at the way that slack conveys information https://slack.com/is/team-communication   (notice even the url hammers home their function).\n\nI think that honest feedback is very imporant and that your main problem here, which is something that affects us all, is that you are too close to the product.  You already understand it, you speak its language (invented words and all), and you are now longer able to communicate it to the passing man in the street.  I suggest workshoping your pitch and language with fresh ears constantly until you are able to get someone to understand the basics of what it is and how it helps them in 10 seconds or less.  All that said, I'm rooting for you, best of luck!","quality":1.0,"submitter":"caidan","submitted":"7 hours ago","parent_id":null},{"story_id":9144271,"id":9144623,"is_dead":false,"body":"yeah...heroku is weird about naked domains. you need to use a DNS provider like DNSimple to set up your domain correctly with Heroku.

I got it after reading the blog post, so I would suggest to condense that information and make it glanceable/scanable in the main page (that is to say, the visitor should be able to understand what is it and why is it useful without having to read much).Take a look for example at the landing page of stripe dedicated to bitcoin: https://stripe.com/bitcoin — in less than 10 seconds I can get what is it about (and even how to integrate it) and I didn't have to read or watch a video. That's more or less what you should aim for so completely new visitors can go \"oh, this cool, I could use it, let me signup\". As it stands right now, your copy (keep friends in the loop, communicate better and get things done quicker) isn't very compelling to get someone to sign up.Also, what is your target group? For example, do you expect the product to be used mainly by developers and makers? Because in that case the main page should be tailored to speak to them (the current copy, imo, doesn't, too generic to get a dev excited).Does the name need to be OpenLoopz? To me the z there makes it sounds like a product for kids and not very professional. Personally I'd consider going for another brand if it's possible at all.\n\nResolving these issues won't get you users and customers overnight, but I think it'd put the product in a much better position to start.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"Mahn","submitted":"7 hours ago","parent_id":null},{"story_id":9144271,"id":9144643,"is_dead":false,"body":"Ditto all this.

It's still completely useless for moving units. People are just being kind.Get an editor. If there's one rule you need to follow, it's brevity. Brevity. BREVITY. It's not rocket science. This isn't beyond you. You aren't doomed to failure. Be brief. Be critical. You've failed at communicating your product's worth. Now try again. Not tomorrow. Today.And don't let perfect be the enemy of good. It's not going to take you a week to fix this. Limit yourself to 400 words, and some screen shots. Fix it today. After that's done, keep iterating.

The word \"openloopz\" was coined about 7 years ago when I first started working on this \"project\" and 'z' was kinda cool back then ;-)  The project has changed a lot since then but the name became quite close to me and I put a lot of work into the assets, so I stuck with it. I have considered changing it to Loop and would love to do that, but it would be a lot of work and I was focused on getting something out there as quickly as possible.3. The welcome page is a work in progress.  I originally had something more detailed with LOADS of screenshots and features, even a video with my own voice (eugh!).   But I was advised to focus on why customers would want to use the product as opposed to focusing on features, and all the content became obsolete when I changed the look and feel.

I would never write something like this on a more mainstream site - it was written for hackers in the same position as me so I felt I could afford to be more down to earth.

I showed up to your site wanting to try it just because it was new (early adopter stereotype), but I couldn't tell what it is.The Medium article is better, but I think you'd be well served to partner with someone who is really good at branding and messaging.  This isn't just about window dressing, it goes a bit deeper than that.For example: you need to show me one painful problem your product solves within 2 seconds of me coming to your homepage.  When in consumer mode, I don't really care if you're solving ten painful problems - just show me one very clearly and I'm almost sure to kick the tires on the product.  A strong branding \u0026 messaging partner will intuitively know how to help you do this for your product, in addition to providing a more user-level view on how to talk about it.I think you have an interesting idea here after reading the Medium post.  If you can help me use Slack as a to do list and you're solving that single problem really well, that's definitely something I'd pay a monthly fee for.\n\nThat said, while I would gladly pay SaaS-level monthly fees for sexy todo integration in Slack, if you make me learn an entirely new vocabulary to do it (loops and whatnot), this cost alone immediately prices out my interest.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"tkimmel","submitted":"7 hours ago","parent_id":null},{"story_id":9144271,"id":9144945,"is_dead":false,"body":"Take the \"How it works\" section of your Medium post - _Particularly_ the excellent screen caps - condense the text, and then make this your homepage.\n\nReading takes more time for me to understand what your product does than looking at pictures.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"sankho","submitted":"7 hours ago","parent_id":null},{"story_id":9144271,"id":9144964,"is_dead":false,"body":"If you're Joel Spolsky you can release a piece of software with any name you care to choose and people will still take it seriously because you have earned the respect of your peers.

I'm asking myself \"is this worth my time?\" Show me a gif of OpenLoop in action. Or make a short screencast (with actual video of the software, not a high-level animation) and stick it right in the hero. Put up a demo at demo.openlooopz.com. Automatically wipe/reimage the account every night to keep out spam and vulgarity. Let people play with it.Explore verticals. Are there verticals currently using OpenLoop really well? Project Managers? Nurses? Accountants? Is it really great at bug tracking? Highlight those on your website - \"Project Managers use OpenLoop to Deliver Great Products\", \"Squash bugs quickly with OpenLoop\". Build some dedicated landing pages for those verticals and buy some FB ads. Measure pageviews/signups and see who is most interested.Testimonials or Case Studies. Talk to people currently using OpenLoop and ask them for a quote to put on your page.Blogs. Setup a tumblr in 15 seconds and start blogging about how people are using OpenLoop. Publish guides on popular workflows. Publish ways you're different than your competitors.Refine your copy. People generally don't read large blocks of text.

That is too much time spent trying to evaluate a product and not seeing any progress.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"developer1","submitted":"1 hour ago","parent_id":null},{"story_id":9144271,"id":9147650,"is_dead":false,"body":"Also, there's a bias on HN (and the world in general but here in particular) against giving real, polite negative feedback (note downvoting without comment).","quality":1.0,"submitter":"flyingrocks","submitted":"1 hour ago","parent_id":9144787},{"story_id":9144271,"id":9147677,"is_dead":false,"body":"I don't get it.

This is because it seems (I haven't tried it) like a complicated tool.Focus on building a solid onboarding process that walks users through the usage of the product. This will be more useful to your users than any video or screenshots.\n\nThis is all without having tried the product or knowing too much about the space/your ideal users, so take it with a grain of salt.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"taylorscollon","submitted":"4 minutes ago","parent_id":null}]}
