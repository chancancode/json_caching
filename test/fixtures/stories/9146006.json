Cumulative graphs make even moderate or bumpy growth look predictable.I guarantee the company KPI here is acquired users / month, not total users. Look closely: January 2013 was probably a kind of scary month. October 2012 was awesome ... and they didn't repeat it until 2 years later.\n\nThis is great for investors and the public, but you can't drive with this graph.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"trjordan","submitted":"47 minutes ago","parent_id":null},{"story_id":9146006,"id":9147765,"is_dead":false,"body":"The chart is a cumulative chart to hide the fact that the source data is only eight data points from various blogs. That's very sleazy and borderline misleading because it creates an extrapolation as mentioned in the comment above.If you are interested in making this a series, use robust data, or don't do it at all.\n\nAdditionally, an area chart is the incorrect type of chart for this kind of graph, since the area under the curve does not represent the total number of users. (You'd use an area chart of the y-axis is number of new users.) A line chart would be more accurate.","quality":1.0,"submitter":"minimaxir","submitted":"30 minutes ago","parent_id":9147664}]}
