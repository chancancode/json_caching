Here are some really bad examples of what I mean:  Clarity in speech, clear division of responsibility, product delivery / QA process norms, onboarding processes, personal respect, etc.\n\nYou might not mean any of these things when you say \"culture\".  I realize this is an incredibly hard if not impossible task -- the whole reason we defer to Culture is because its importance is matched only by its complexity.  However, given that it seems like such a ubiquitous and important factor for startup success, I feel that progress in producing better startups can only be made by tackling this problem on the low-level.",

The control panel lets the user set up IP options, time, etc. as well as control bandwidth usage, scheduling, etc. They can also see the amount of space used and set up notifications of some kind (reboot for updates, disk space, etc.).This little device just sits in a corner and is effectively a multi-TB shard of this 20 PB and growing cloud storage system preserving the Internet.

The best way to do so depends heavily on the type of company you're talking about and who wants to know the information, but many companies choose to keep multiple sets of books--one that follows the IRS's rules (this one is required), one that follows the SEC's rules (required if they are a publicly traded corporation), one for non-public investors, and one used internally allows management to make strategic decisions and departments to make plans.The existence of various ways of considering the finances of a corporation don't necessarily mean that any one method is \"wrong\". But when you get into questions of \"is it profitable?\" The answer depends a lot on who's asking.In any one month, more money may go out of your checking account than came in, but does that mean you lost money that month? Maybe some of the outgoing money was paying for a year's worth of an expensive service, or was an investment in some other company, or was the purchase of some assets that will allow you to become more productive. In those cases, while your cash flow may be negative, you can keep a set of books that spreads the cost of a year's worth of service over the entire year, even if you pay it all at once on January 1. Or a building you might want to spread the cost out over the duration of any loans you took out to pay for part of it, or if you paid cash, you still may want to spread the expense out over the 15 year expected lifetime of the asset.Obviously the IRS and SEC rules have to be pretty standard across the board, but within any particular industry or business model, a different representation may provide investors or management with a more accurate picture than the IRS or SEC rules would allow.\n\nObviously all of these can be abused, and investors should be skeptical and do due diligence, but even 100% honest businesses may report a loss to the IRS, a profit to investors, and a break-even for the SEC.

Fall out of favour with certain government agencies and suddenly that constant stream of background checks slows, deadlines get missed, and profits become loss.

The temptation is to split their agency, their consciousness and their participation into a boolean and say they either have it or they don't have it, that psychiatric disorders must be entirely out of someone's control before we give them a pass on \"But it's their fault\" and \"Just snap out of it!\".  But allocating problems this severe to the realm of personal responsibility and purely voluntary deviancy is not very helpful to anyone.The most infuriating thing about having a family member with a personality disorder, my own dive into ab-psych, is that they can turn it on and off in certain contexts, they can be triggered and they can avoid being triggered, but not in a context where you need them to, where you beg them to. It is a way in which they are acting, an unhealthy coping mechanism and pattern of thinking that colors all their thoughts - but it is not something that they can't control or observe at all, only something that they don't usually control or observe well enough to avoid causing problems.  There is no clear line between their disorder and their voluntary behavior and their personality, it is one unified whole.Before we started medicalizing these things, we relied on public shaming and ostracism to control them until the person's behavior got so out of control they became a danger.  While it's a cruel way of doing things that we have wholeheartedly rejected, it was surely at least somewhat effective, because of this voluntary component, because telling yourself \"Keep it together\" is not a 0% effective treatment technique. The country did not suffer from a 26% mental illness rate in times past, and I think it's foolish to assume this represents pure underreporting.  Mental illness at least partially conforms to the outlines of the society which defines it - immigrants to the US find themselves substantially healthier than the US on arrival, but develop statistically average rates of US mental illness over time;  Symptoms shift from whatever is recognized in their home country to symptoms more in line with US-recognized disorders.We have decided, rightly or wrongly, that classifying these things according to an insurance-industry handbook, and doling out pills like candy, and pretending these people have no control whatsoever over their disorder in order to relieve them of social responsibility for it, is the correct approach. While the truth is more complex, I tend to find this more humane than some other national attitudes towards the topic, and I have no better approach to offer.\n\nEdit: The problem is, when you acknowledge that these things are maladaptive and problematic behaviors that someone presently does not control well, rather than some kind of seizure that completely robs one of consciousness...  you get people popping up who want to go back to the boolean definition again and deny there's any problem whatsoever, claim that they're doing this for attention and faking it and horrible hoaxers who are sucking the precious fluids from our society... There may be too many douchebags out there for a nuanced view to prevail.  I see this post already has one, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9147386 . The problem is the boolean: A 100% controlled premeditated affectation must represent a malicious manipulator, the theory goes.  But the mind isn't so simple.",

It was cool to have \"mental issues\" in some crowds, mainly the \"goth\" kids(I put goth in quotes there because there's a distinct difference between the goth subculture and the typically white, middle class kids who shop at hot topic). In searching for their identity, they found a great way to provoke responses from people, particularly adults, by appearing to be disturbed in some fashion. Claiming to hear voices, drawing violent images, etc. Some would take it this far and have arbitrary \"episodes\", but it really was all just a show. Knowing several personally, they were just like anyone else when you got to know them, but they wanted to appear different from the larger school population. They had loving families, comfortable homes, pretty bright kids. Today they've essentially become they railed against in their younger years, jocks, preps, \"conformists\".

Something that is big enough to be well-known, heavily used by a large enough number of users that it brings a lot of stress, but is not big enough (by some definition of \"big\" and \"enough\") to support a team to make it all go smoothly.I've been in that same boat most of my professional career, and in fact I'm about 16 years into my journey working with the same project (Webmin; which started out with me having a company that used it in products and then ended up with me pivoting and starting a new company based around it); I'm lucky enough to not be the primary developer, and I'm lucky enough to have always had just enough money to keep an extra support person on staff and occasionally pay to make some problems go away (translations now and then, accessibility testing, UI and design assets, etc.), but having some huge number of people expecting things to always Just Work, and never have security problems, and never be confusing, and always get better but also never change in any way that might effect the way they use it, is a definite source of stress that I don't think people working in large companies will ever experience (though they experience their own sorts of stress and I don't think I would trade, even for much better pay).I've had to step back a few times over the years, in more subtle ways than this. And, I've spent time on other projects and other jobs (either to make money or just to have something else to think about and to play with new languages and tools). But, it's strange to look back on so many years of doing roughly the same thing.\n\nIt's also odd to think of things that have been so clearly defined by their founder no longer being operated by their founder. This is, I guess, kinda like Rob stepping down from Slashdot a few years back. Turned out not to really effect Slashdot all that much (though I don't know how relevant Slashdot remains today, since I so rarely visit); I wonder if Metafilter has the team to keep it spinning...it's also a site I haven't spent much time at in recent years.",

Of course there are some innocent people who are killed and injured by drink drivers, and these cases are particular tragedies, but most deaths resulting from drink driving are either people who kill themselves by stupidity, or at least consent to be in a vehicle where the driver is DUI.Another thing I could bring up from analysis of traffic deaths is the large number of suicides we have  -- about 20 % of traffic deaths; this is becoming a burden on truck drivers because they carry a lot of the emotional burden when someone decide to smash their car at high speed to an oncoming truck.\n\nAnd yet another astonishing factor is deaths of \"natural causes\" (heart attack, stroke etc) while driving.

Often in emergency situations, you need to speed up rather than slow down to prevent an accident.

I have, at times, needed to have bursts of speed into the 90s to safely get around a drunk driver going 70.You're now asking for cars to behave unpredictably based on their determination of the road conditions.And you set the limiter to 75. Now someone is driving 75 in a 25.Most highway deaths are rural[1] and involve a single car - they veer off of narrow lanes into a ditch or trees, or hit a large animal. The difference in reaction time needed to avoid said animals or other obstructions is not that different from 75mph to 90mph - low visibility is the underlying problem there, not speed.The idea that we're suddenly safer on roads if we limit speeds is also not necessarily true.In 2013, German autobahns accounted for 31% of the countries traffic, yet only 13% of the deaths. They had a rate of 1.9 deaths per billion kilometers travelled, while urban roads had 4.7, and rural roads 6.6.I don't think there's really evidence to support the idea that limiting our cars to lower speeds will be beneficial.\n\n[1] http://www.npr.org/2009/11/29/120716625/the-deadliest-roads-...",

One might be inclined to think Dash for iOS at $10 might be a hard sell but it has done really good. On comparing to another app priced at $3.99 with same number of downloads, the returns have been much higher.So the issue doesn't stop with whether I can make it back.

The employee then purchases those shares from us in line with a vesting agreement. All warrants and conversions are exactly the same as the founders shares.This means that they pay tax on this purchase as regular income rather than capital gains up front with the money we give them for it. This prevents a heavy tax bill at conversion and allows them to retain their vested shares regardless of if they work for us or not after the first 12 month vesting period.We calculated that the up front taxes are magnitudes cheaper in the long run because the increased valuation will cover those differences handily and there is no waiting period like there is with capital gains tax.\n\nIn the end though our intention was to make a simple way for our employees to actually own the stock we give them as compensation and it not be something that they can lose or be restructured easily. If a VC or acquisition wanted to restructure that away for employees then they would be forced to restructure everyone's, so we are all in.",

Once this happens, it can cost $x,xxx's of dollars for employees if they're given founders stock (restricted stock) upfront, compared to stock options that have no upfront cost.\n\nOne solution to this is to give employees a signing bonus to buy the restricted stock upfront, so it cancels out the amount they owe upfront. Alternatively, you could grant stock options, and sign something that says the company will give them a bonus equal to the exercise price of the options.",

Someone (company or you) is buying the option early, thus having less money to spend on other things.Alternatives could be the company pays you that money, so it's yours to spend as you see fit.

It involved an acquisition with a management incentive plan and preferences that together left nothing for common.Among other things the court held that where there is a conflict of interest the board must prefer the interests of common shareholders over those specific to preferred (the interests of preferred over common being contractual). It also found that the board had acted procedurally unfairly and in several places suggested outright dishonesty. For those reasons it applied the harshest standard under Delaware law (entire fairness).\n\nIn the end however, it found that the company's value as an ongoing concern though not nothing, was not enough to overcome the large liquidation preference and cumulative dividend. Thus, since prior to the deal common stock was worthless a deal valuing them as worthless was fair within the meaning of Delaware law. Note that the litigation lasted 8 years, and at the end of the linked decision it was an open question whether the defendants were going to have to pay plaintiff's legal fees despite having won.

In expectation, one would probably make more money working at FB/Google/Apple over a lifetime than at a random startup. Founders would likely prosper, and of course investors will likely recoup their money but most of the time a staff engineer wouldn't make much. I feel that the VCs in the valley are running this racket of seducing and exploiting talent, all the while knowing that most folks wouldn't get much out of the hard work.

This is true for many in California with the high state taxes and a relatively high gross income (versus national averages).However, if the intrinsic value portion of your exercise (i.e. fair market value minus your strike price) as an addition to your AMT worksheet does not indicate you'll owe AMT for the year, then you will NOT see a tax event. This will be true for many non-Californians exercising after their first year, or even after 4 years, depending on the growth of the fair-market-value.\n\nIf you are at risk of paying AMT and your intrinsic value is in the low 6-figures (or lower), one solution might be to wait until the beginning of a new tax year, exercise, and quit your job... then take a year off from wages and work for equity (i.e. form your own startup).  You'll avoid paying the 26% on that money due at exercise. If you've been paying AMT in the past, you'll even get a tax credit at the end of the year. Obviously, this plan is not without risks, should only be carried-out if you believe in solid growth in the startup for which you own equity and believe in the ability of the new startup you're founding and/or joining.

Can you elaborate on schemes in which common shares are made to become worthless?

Maybe still overall less compensation than Google would've given me, but more likely to change my life.If I'm part of the founding team of a company with no product out right now, that's paying me 20-50% of what Google would pay me, and any monetization event is clearly 7+ years off, 1% is a lot less exciting for four different reasons:  1.  Obviously I'm giving up more salary.  2.  Payout is less likely.  3.  Payout even if it happens is farther away.  4.  (Crucially) My stake is very likely to be much further diluted before any monetization events.If you ACTUALLY get 1% of the monetization of any reasonably successful company, you're probably doing pretty damn well.

    "body": "This is an inadequate overview of options issues for startup employees. The major issues are probably:1. Acceleration on change of control (the article covers this). 1 year acceleration is fairly common it seems. There should be something here. But fully acceleration of granted options is probably more than you realistically can hope for. After all, you didn't need to work for that year to get the options. There should be some balance here.2. Rule 83b electoins. Particularly relevant for pre-funding startups and especially for founders. It allows you to pay all the tax on options up front rather than be hit by yearly AMT bills;3. Clawback agreements. This is a nasty one that was most publicly brought to light with Skype (the second time around). A bunch of executives were fired before the acquisition went through, allegedly for performance reasons. Their options could be bought back at issue price, resulting in a windfall for SilverLake of possibly several hundred million. Want to sue? Well the company was incorporated overseas. Good luck with that.The moral of the story is watch out for any rights the company has to repurchase your options and at what price.Repurchases in general aren't necessarily evil. It's good to avoid having a lot of shareholders for early stage companies (due to SEC limits on number of shareholders for non-public companies) but such repurchases need to be fair.4. You're taxed on options based on their fair market value when they're issued barring a Rule 83b election;5. Liquidation preferences. VCs generally have some form of preferential treatment on how they're repaid in the event of a buyout. This can take a number of forms.The most reasonable is that they're simply guaranteed to get their money back. Meaning if they paid $10M for a 40% stake in a company that gets bought for $15M they're going to get their $10M back instead of 40% * $15M = $6M. That's not unreasonable.But what's not reasonable (IMHO) is \"participating preferred\" liquidation preferences. What this means in the above scenario is the VC will get $10M of the $15M back and then 40% of the remaining $5M. So the other 60% are divvying up $3M. That's a lot less attractive.6. Bonuses in lieu of acquisition. You may see a headline that says your company has been bought for $100M and you own 1%. Great! You're now a millionaire! Not so fast...It may turn out the VC owns 40% participating preferred with $20M funding and the company is actually only being bought for $50M. The other $50M is incentives in the new company paid to the founders and possibly key executives.So you're only getting 1% of $30M.7. Dilution. Your 1% may not be 1%. You may have been told something like \"there are 1M shares outstanding and we're granting you 10,000 options over 4 years with 1 year cliff\". So you own 1% right? Well, maybe you do and maybe you don't.The company may be reporting outstanding shares rather than outstanding shares plus any obligations it's made. It really needs to report on a fully diluted basis. There may be convertible notes and rights of existing VCs to buy in in future funding rounds, etc.\n\nSo anyway there are a lot of potential traps.",

We have a concurrent, incremental compaction algorithm that goes through the old blocks, frees the ones that are outdated, and moves things around when some blocks have mostly garbage.The system is very fast and rock solid. But...\n\nGetting a storage engine like that to production state is an enormous amount of work and takes a very long time.

In memory data structures...this is the contention of the functional programming people.2. Persistent data stores. This is the lsm style of data structure that substitutes linear writes and compaction for buffered in-place mutation.3. Distributed system internals--this is a log-centric, \"state machine replication\" style of data flow between nodes. This is a classic approach in distributed databases, and present in systems like PNUTs.4. Company-wide data integration and processing around streams of immutable records between systems. This is what I have argued for (http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what...) and I think Martin is mostly talking about.There are a lot of analogies between these but they aren't the same. Success of one of these things doesn't really imply success for any of the others. Functional programming could lose and log-structured data stores could win or vice versa. Pat Helland has made an across the board call for immutability (http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf), but that remains a pretty strong assertion. So it is worth being specific about which level you are thinking about.\n\nFor my part I am pretty bullish about stream processing and data flow between systems being built around a log or stream of immutable records as the foundational abstraction. But whether those systems internally are built in functional languages, use lsm style data layout on disk is kind of an implementation detail. From my point of view immutability is a lot more helpful in the large than in the small--I have never found small imperative for loops particularly hard to read, but process-wide mutable state is a big pain, and undisciplined dataflow between disparate systems, caches, and applications at the company level can be a real disaster.",

Maybe append-only does not make sense in operational databases all the time, but for non-real-time analytics, it makes a huge amount of sense. In my case, operational data is queried, optimized for storage space and quick loading, and cached to disk.  Because it is an analytics database used for longer-term analysis and planning, daily queries of operational data are sufficient in many cases. Operational workload is not even a consideration. The ETL process also allows for \"updating\" records in the \"T\" (transform) part. Updates to operational data are not even necessary, and often impossible, so correcting and enhancing the data for decision making is a huge win for clients. Issues similar to \"compaction time\" can still occur, but an ETL approach allows for many clean ways of controlling the process and avoiding those failure scenarios.",

Many human problems deal with abstract representations of the actual data, and so imprecision is part of the problem.\n\nI really like the talk from the point of view of simplifying the system-wide problems caused by a gigantic mutable state.

You mention that people are \"excluded\" from rights and privileges, but the problem with the globalist view you espouse is that by lumping in a nation and it's people with the world you remove the political lines in a meaningful form.National Sovereignty is the real issue at hand here, but it's a sensitive subject that not very many people like to touch. I've heard some fairly powerful beltway people reference it as dead, but if that's true our entire government is operating under a fallacy, there are some big implications here and I would love to see more academic research (as in, if anyone has any links I would appreciate them) on the subject.I do think the lessons of the internet are important here though, namely that if you try to claim no nationality, peoples nationality becomes Earth, and a global government along with it. I want to go the opposite direction, less federal power, more state power, more local power (constitutionally restricted of course).The only oath I ever swore was to protect and defend the Constitution, and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit back and watch America be Europeanized without an intellectual fight, because my forefathers fought hard to establish the freedoms I have here that still don't exist anywhere else in the world.Yes I'm aware of the other countries higher levels of \"actual\" freedom, particularly the nordic ones, but I think our idealistic vision is still a superior one. For example, Vincent Reynouard of France was recently sentenced to two years in jail for his non-violent historical opinions regarding the Holocaust. I tend to side with Voltaire on free speech, apparently the French don't.\n\nThese same issues are also readily apparent in the TPP.

People move different state to live and to do business for various reasons but most are really the benefits that other states offer.There is a difference between nationalism (being loyal and passionate about one's nationality) and identity. This is particularly obvious when it comes to ethnicity and nationality. Do I identify myself as Chinese or Chinese American? As a Chinese do I identify myself as a Chinese-speaking HK person or a Chinese? Does one identifying oneself as American because of natural birth is the same as being a nationalist? When two New Yorkers ask each other \"where are you from\" is it significant to hear \"I am from Queens\", \"I am from Bronx\"? You don't hear two people say \"I am human, an earthly being\" because obviously they are human and it would be redundant to even say to each other as introduction.

Yet, some don't have that nationality tag like many here do.\n\nIn China there is census register system (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system).

As the game playing programs advance beyond the 2D full-screen games, they'll need a low-level system to handle the next moves (\"don't fall off platform\", \"jump to next platform\", \"shoot at target\" are primitives for the 2D sidescroller era) and some level of planner to handle tactical matters and strategy.It's possible to explicitly build hierarchical systems like that now, using classical planning techniques to modify the goals of a machine learning system.  It's not yet possible to get a hierarchical system to emerge from machine learning.  Medium term planning as an emergent behavior is a near term big challenge for AI.\n\nBeyond such a two-level system, we're going to need intercommunicating components that do different parts of the problem. The components may be evolved, while the architecture may be designed.  When AI systems can design such architectures, they're probably ready to take over.",

Here, deep neural nets are able to learn how to represent the massive state space for vision quite well, but there's a bit of a mismatch in games where actions have to be taken in a specific order (e.g., where extended pathfinding is required) because for reinforcement learning to work well, your features need to capture that sort of temporally extended state information.That's still a hard problem, but not insurmountable, and there's already strides in that direction.

    "body": "I really like this line of work and I expect will grow quite substantially over the next few years. Of course, Reinforcement Learning has been around for a long time. Similarly, Q Learning (the core model in this paper) has been around a very long time. What is new is that normally you see these models applied to toy MDP problems with simple dynamics, and linear Q function approximations for fear of non-convergence etc. What's novel about this work is that they fully embrace a complex non-linear Q function (ConvNet) looking at the raw pixels, and get it to actually work in (relatively speaking) complex environments (games). This requires several important tricks, as is discussed at length in their Nature paper (e.g. experience replay, updating the Q function only once in a while, etc.).I implemented the DQN algorithm (used in this work) in Javascript a while ago as well (http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo...) if people are interested in poking around, but my version does not implement all the bells and whistles.The results in this work are impressive, but also too easy to antropomorphise. If you know what's going on under the hood you can start to easily list off why this is unlike anything humans/animals do. Some of the limitations include:- Most curcially, the exploration used is random. You button mash random things and hope to receive a reward at some point or you're completely lost. If anything at any point requires a precise sequence of actions to get a reward, exponentially more training time is necessary.- Experience replay that performs the model updates is performed uniformly at random, instead of some kind of importance sampling. This one is easier to fix.- A discrete set of actions is assumed. Any real-valued output (e.g. torque on a join) is a non-obvious problem in the current model.- There is no transfer learning between games. The algorithm always starts from scratch. This is very much unlike what humans do in their own problem solving.- The agent's policy is reactive. It's as if you always forgot what you did 1 second ago. You keep repeatedly \"waking up\" to the world and get 1 second to decide what to do.- Q Learning is model-free, meaning that the agent builds no internal model of the world/reward dynamics. Unlike us, it doesn't know what will happen to the world if it perfoms some action. This also means that it does not have any capacity to plan anything.Of these, the biggest and most insurmountable problem is the first one: Random exploration of actions. As humans we have complex intuitions and an internal model of the dynamics of the world. This allows us to plan out actions that are very likely to yield a reward, without flailing our arms around greedily, hoping to get rewards at random at some point.Games like Starcraft will significantly challenge an algorithm like this. You could expect that the model would develop super-human micro, but have difficulties with the overall strategy. For example, performing an air drop to enemy base would be impossible with the current model: You'd have to plan it out over many actions: \"load the marines into the ship, fly the ship in stealth around the map, drop it at the precise location of enemy base\".\n\nHence, DQN is best at games that provide immediate rewards, and where you can afford to \"live in the moment\" without much planning. Shooting things in space invaders is a good example. Despite all these shortcoming, these are exciting results!",

There's some merit to the argument that it's much riskier and probably more expensive for the cartels to kidnap and hold these people than to pay them enough to work voluntarily. The main argument against that is how many people have disappeared with no contact with their families, and that the families aren't getting any money. But then, we don't know where these people are, what they're doing, and what degree, if any, of coercion is being applied.\n\nThe wild card is the Governments' unwillingness to even acknowledge the problem. That suggests that it embarrasses them. What's more embarrassing to the government, though? That the cartels might be powerful enough to kidnap people at will all over their country? Doesn't sound particularly newsworthy or worthy of suppression, considering what else is going on there. How about the extent to which upper-middle class educated people are willingly working with the cartels to build high-end infrastructure? I could see that being very embarrassing indeed. It makes it seem like the cartels are inching closer to being the legitimate government of major parts of the country. That sounds much more like something worth denying and suppressing. I have no idea if there's any truth to it, but the motives seem to line up in that direction.",

    "body": "In the case of the cartels there's varying degrees of \"voluntarily.\" Mexican and Colombian cartels have long been able to coerce \"voluntary\" cooperation from people they need by posing them a choice: plata o plomo, \"silver or lead.\" In other words, you can cooperate with the cartel and be rewarded with cash, or not cooperate and be \"rewarded\" with bullets. It's your choice! But it's not much of a choice, of course.\n\nWhat's interesting here (to me, anyway) is the need to physically kidnap and hold the person, rather than just coercing the behavior the cartels want via the plata o plomo approach. The cartels certainly have enough plata to hire talent, if it's needed; and once hired, the threat of the plomo should keep them quiet, right? So what would the cartel gain by enslaving the person? I'm not sure.",

The word \"openloopz\" was coined about 7 years ago when I first started working on this \"project\" and 'z' was kinda cool back then ;-)  The project has changed a lot since then but the name became quite close to me and I put a lot of work into the assets, so I stuck with it. I have considered changing it to Loop and would love to do that, but it would be a lot of work and I was focused on getting something out there as quickly as possible.3. The welcome page is a work in progress.  I originally had something more detailed with LOADS of screenshots and features, even a video with my own voice (eugh!).   But I was advised to focus on why customers would want to use the product as opposed to focusing on features, and all the content became obsolete when I changed the look and feel.  Anyway, I will take all the comments on board and revise the landing page - I agree it could be a lot better.\n\nStill reading... will respond to individual feedback separately.",

For example, high-school kids looking to chat and have fun will never bother learning your concept and pay you $5 for the privilege.  Get rid of all marketing messages aimed at that use case.  Will college students pay you $5 to collaborate on a school project? Stop marketing to them.  Will a family use this to plan their vacation?

I don't like the headline font for your site, the lack of screenshots, basically the lack of focus on a product that will live or die on its usability and interface.   I'm not a fan of the Z in openloopz.  Combined with the comic sansy looking headline font it doesn't feel polished.The inventing of a new words (\"loops\") is to be avoided unless absolutely necessary.  You are now not only trying to tell a (very) mildly interested reader about your product you need them to learn a new language in order to understand it.  This is an unrealistic cognitive burden for a sales pitch for a todo app.  I strongly suggest that you use the simplest possible terms in plain language to describe the focus of your product, how it fits into the users life, and what problems it solves for them.Your post here is more focused on your personal suffering than on your product.  We are all eating shit to try to launch our companies, but too much focus on that makes for a downer intro to your product.  I'd try to separate your moments of sharing the struggle and the moments of sharing the product.  Do you want people to be genuinely excited about it, or pity you?  Which emotion do you want to be a stronger first response?Scanning further over your medium article (It's longer than a casual browser will give it time, ie 5 seconds) I suggest you take whatever the salient feature of your product is, maybe the hashtagging to create inline tasks and put that front and center in a huge picture and font.  I'm still not sure what problem you are solving or who you are competing with, is it todo lists, slack, what?  Where does this tool fit in my life?   I suggest you take a look at the way that slack conveys information https://slack.com/is/team-communication   (notice even the url hammers home their function).\n\nI think that honest feedback is very imporant and that your main problem here, which is something that affects us all, is that you are too close to the product.  You already understand it, you speak its language (invented words and all), and you are now longer able to communicate it to the passing man in the street.  I suggest workshoping your pitch and language with fresh ears constantly until you are able to get someone to understand the basics of what it is and how it helps them in 10 seconds or less.  All that said, I'm rooting for you, best of luck!",

Is the product still in \"BETA\"? What does that mean nowadays in 2015?4. When I click on \"Pricing\", how do I sign-up? When I click a plan (e.g. Basic, Premium, Business) - nothing happens.5. I don't understand your pricing strategy. You have free, you have $5/mo and then you have \"contact us\" which implies to me super expensive. How do you go from $0/$5 to super expensive with no middle ground?6. I'm confused, is the product ready to be used or not? I see that I can sign up for a $5 plan (under Pricing tab) but I also see I can provide my email address when the product RELEASED (under the BETA tab). So which is it ... is the product available today or not?7. What the heck is a \"loop\". I read the \"What is a Loop\" but am still confused.Please don't take my comments as being harass. I'm simply trying to provide my personal opinion on how you can be successful (which I believe all of us at HN want).I fundamentally see a complete lack of focus on the homepage.I'd suggest you reconstruct the homepage to be more focused, something more similar to https://campfirenow.com/  where you get a quick screenshot of the product. The home page is simply (mainly all \"above the fold\"). Sign up and pricing is clear. etc.\n\nAll the best. I wish you well.",

That said, \"Loop\" is not the word I would use to describe the main unit of content.  It is not intuitive at all, which is a large part of the problem - I think \"Stream\" is a clearer name (or \"Feed\" if you prefer the FriendsFeed style of things).  That also means you don't need \"Bundles\" for saved searches - everything is a \"Stream\", some of which are \"pinned\" to the sidebar.I really like how composable streams are - the use of tags makes it easy to merge content across streams, but by not requiring the use of tags you make it easy for me to jump in and start adding content.Tags with values is a genius idea - want to add ratings to your photos, simply add `#rating:{n}` - then create a stream of your favorite photos by simply pinning a search for `#rating:>3` ... awesome!  I could also seeing using this for triaging bug reports, assigning priorities to #todo entries ... very elegant.I will be adding more thoughts into @loop feedback stream as they come to me.\n\nOne last time, nicely done - and good luck with your next iteration!",

I showed up to your site wanting to try it just because it was new (early adopter stereotype), but I couldn't tell what it is.The Medium article is better, but I think you'd be well served to partner with someone who is really good at branding and messaging.  This isn't just about window dressing, it goes a bit deeper than that.For example: you need to show me one painful problem your product solves within 2 seconds of me coming to your homepage.  When in consumer mode, I don't really care if you're solving ten painful problems - just show me one very clearly and I'm almost sure to kick the tires on the product.  A strong branding & messaging partner will intuitively know how to help you do this for your product, in addition to providing a more user-level view on how to talk about it.I think you have an interesting idea here after reading the Medium post.  If you can help me use Slack as a to do list and you're solving that single problem really well, that's definitely something I'd pay a monthly fee for.\n\nThat said, while I would gladly pay SaaS-level monthly fees for sexy todo integration in Slack, if you make me learn an entirely new vocabulary to do it (loops and whatnot), this cost alone immediately prices out my interest.",

    "body": "I created an account, which is apparently more than half the people commenting here were willing to do (most people apparently took one look at your landing page, didn't understand the product, and closed the tab).1. The first page after logging in says \"To get started, type something in the Edit Box above and hit ENTER when you are done. Everything you create here will be visible to you and I because we are the only members of this loop.\" The last point on the page says \"If you have any questions or feedback, just add a note in the Edit Box above and I'll make sure I forward it to the right people!\"Which is it? Private testing ground or feedback form? This isn't a good start, confusing and contradicting your new users.2. The default/showcase loops are annoying. I don't want my account to be cluttered with tutorial content. An intuitive interface and clean documentation should be enough.Worse, you cannot delete these default loops. I spent 10 minutes simply trying to remove the tutorial content without receiving \"not found\" or \"permission denied\" errors. Turns out you can only remove the shortcuts from the menu, not the loops themselves. I imagine this is because you implemented these as a single loop shared across all accounts rather than importing a copy of these loops per new account. Bad implementation - why are you presenting me with the functionality to delete the loop only to prevent me from doing so?I would not clutter every new account with tutorial content. A new account should be perfectly clean so I can start using it, rather than wasting time trying to determine what are core pages vs. tutorial content. Also cannot remove the annoying \"Loopy\" page.3. The transitions and animations are not cool. They are very distracting and slow down the use of the application by several factors. You said this project started a long time ago, and the way the UI tries to be fancy in my face seems to confirm this. An animation on every single mouse click is not acceptable since 2010+.4. The hassle of just trying to kill the tutorial content imported to my new account, coupled with the in-my-face transition animations wasted the full amount of time I invest in trying out a new web app. The initial process frustrated me and chased me away from checking out the real product.\n\nSorry, I spent 15 minutes reading the landing page and exploring the first steps after logging in and got nowhere. That is too much time spent trying to evaluate a product and not seeing any progress.",

I got it after reading the blog post, so I would suggest to condense that information and make it glanceable/scanable in the main page (that is to say, the visitor should be able to understand what is it and why is it useful without having to read much).Take a look for example at the landing page of stripe dedicated to bitcoin: https://stripe.com/bitcoin — in less than 10 seconds I can get what is it about (and even how to integrate it) and I didn't have to read or watch a video. That's more or less what you should aim for so completely new visitors can go \"oh, this cool, I could use it, let me signup\". As it stands right now, your copy (keep friends in the loop, communicate better and get things done quicker) isn't very compelling to get someone to sign up.Also, what is your target group? For example, do you expect the product to be used mainly by developers and makers? Because in that case the main page should be tailored to speak to them (the current copy, imo, doesn't, too generic to get a dev excited).Does the name need to be OpenLoopz? To me the z there makes it sounds like a product for kids and not very professional. Personally I'd consider going for another brand if it's possible at all.\n\nResolving these issues won't get you users and customers overnight, but I think it'd put the product in a much better position to start.",

Once you've done that well, you'll see the beta sign-ups come through. They may not necessarily buy from you just yet but keep in touch with them and learn from their user interactions to improve the product.One of the hardest things is landing the very first customer. But it's not impossible. Good luck!My early thoughts: Based on the website, it's not fully clear what OpenLoopz does and how it does it (i.e. How will it make me communicate better and get things done quicker?). You got me somewhat hooked on \"communicate better and get things done quicker\" so now, tell me can I achieve it with your app. Since a \"Loop\" is a new concept, you'll need to explain it but keep it subtle - as a user, my point is to communicate better and get things done quicker. If a \"Loop\" helps me do it, great. If not, I'm not really interested in what a \"Loop\" is.\n\nI'd focus on trying to serve 1 customer segment at the moment.

That leads us to think that if we could just create a better tool for keeping track of our TODO list, our lives would be easier to manage, and maybe others could benefit from the tool as well.\n\nOf course it never seems to pan out, because what we're trying to manage is our (work) lives, and our lives cannot be represented as a simple task list. There's a lot more nuance and complexity to it. And that's why we end up with a million different implementations of simple TODO lists.",

It doesn't help your situation now, but always start these endeavors as night + weekend projects. Manage your risk. Test the market. Get 5 paying customers, then start thinking about quitting your full time job.So, some feedback...From what I gather, OpenLoop a tool for me to organize information and/or projects, generic enough to be used across many verticals and company orgs. It sounds similar to Trello or Basecamp. And that's OK. I'm not sure if my view is accurate, but that's what I feel like you're trying to sell.\"Show, don't tell\". Go look at trello.com. Go look at basecamp.com/tour. As a potential customer, I want to see screenshots of the software before I signup. I want to see what's different. I'm asking myself \"is this worth my time?\" Show me a gif of OpenLoop in action. Or make a short screencast (with actual video of the software, not a high-level animation) and stick it right in the hero. Put up a demo at demo.openlooopz.com. Automatically wipe/reimage the account every night to keep out spam and vulgarity. Let people play with it.Explore verticals. Are there verticals currently using OpenLoop really well? Project Managers? Nurses? Accountants? Is it really great at bug tracking? Highlight those on your website - \"Project Managers use OpenLoop to Deliver Great Products\", \"Squash bugs quickly with OpenLoop\". Build some dedicated landing pages for those verticals and buy some FB ads. Measure pageviews/signups and see who is most interested.Testimonials or Case Studies. Talk to people currently using OpenLoop and ask them for a quote to put on your page.Blogs. Setup a tumblr in 15 seconds and start blogging about how people are using OpenLoop. Publish guides on popular workflows. Publish ways you're different than your competitors.Refine your copy. People generally don't read large blocks of text. I could tell you were struggling to describe your product because the first item in your FAQ is \"What is a loop\". Ditch the copy and show me the software.Ditch the \"Slack Meets Github\" tagline. Perhaps you only used that here. But it didn't help me understand the product.Naysayers come and go. Don't give up, but make sure you're providing if that's your role. If you're out of fuel (money), time to do a contract gig to earn some more runway. You might even have to go back to full time work and do OpenLoop on the weekends. There is no shame in that. If you can, take a 2 week break from anything OpenLoop related (perhaps a contract) and spend time with your family. You'll come back refreshed and find yourself with tons of new ideas for ways to market/advertise, new verticals to research, better copy, etc.\n\nBest of luck to you sir!",

    "body": "It would probably be quicker if it cached, but don't underestimate the speed of gcc...A year or so ago, as part of my work on Project Clearwater (http://www.projectclearwater.org/), I was using a Ruby tool to retrieve statistics from a server, plumbing them into Cacti (http://www.cacti.net/) and graphing the results.Cacti likes to restart statistics-gathering processes every time it wants new statistics (once a minute in my system), so this meant starting the Ruby interpreter every minute.Project Clearwater is built to be scalable, so I turned up a few hundred nodes (EC2 makes this easy), at which point Cacti couldn't keep up - it took the best part of a second per Ruby process invocation, and since I was polling every minute, there just wasn't enough time to get through all the nodes.I rewrote the Ruby tool in C++, at which point it ran in less than 0.1s, which was fast enough for what I needed.Amusingly (at least to me), it actually _compiled_ (under GCC) and ran in less time than it took for the Ruby interpreter to start.(This is not intended to be a comparison of the merits of C++ and Ruby.  It's quite possible the Ruby code could have been optimized and really I was solving the wrong problem - I probably should have been making the statistics-gathering process long-lived.  The point of the above is just that GCC is actually very quick for relatively small programs.)\n\nMatt",

Previously, the task had been marked \"omit from C\", would you believe it!Also, note the little \"Student exercise\" below the code. For this to be useful, you want to cache the compiler output; you want to recompile the underlying executable only if the C script has changed.\n\nThe inconvenience of invoking C programs obviously isn't the real obstacle to its use as a scripting language, otherwise this kind of thing would be widely used.",

IIRC lots of distros mount /tmp/ with noexec specifically so you can't do this. You might still be able to invoke ld directly to run it, but that's still kinda a hack to get around the noexec.2. You need write access to the .c file. That means you can't install any scripts using this system-wide, because you won't have write-access to the .c source unless you're root.\n\nIMO, the most obvious solution to the second is to make a copy of the .c source and edit that instead. AFAIK there isn't an easy solution to the first issue though.",

There were similar projects done with LLVM.What I would really like to have is some kind of compiler or different C preprocessor that would implement modules, such as that building C would be as simple as building Go programs.
