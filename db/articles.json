For a startup to succeed, it must have a culture that reflects what it wants to achieve. This is one of my areas of expertise. I've spent the past decade focusing on Y Combinator's culture. Here I'm going to tell you what I did and what I learned.<br></p>People and culture have played an important role at Y Combinator from the very beginning. And I was the one responsible for these things from the very beginning. &nbsp;Most people don't know this–both because I prefer to operate in the background and because culture is not as visible to the outside world as what a company does functionally.<p>\"Softer\" stuff like values, culture and community is often ignored by the press, and more dangerously it's also sometimes ignored by founders. Maybe that's because it doesn't seem exciting, or it's too touchy-feely, or it can't be measured. Or maybe when you're trying to solve a technical problem that's never been solved before, company culture seems a secondary consideration.</p><p>But company culture starts when it's just two people working on an idea at the kitchen table. In my experience, the founders who start to care about their culture the soonest also tend to be the ones who build the best companies. In fact, the reason YC has deliberately never offered office space to founders is precisely because of this insight: the founders of individual startups drive the culture from a very early stage and this culture needs to grow organically in the startup's own space.</p><p>Here I'm going to explain some things about the origins of Y Combinator's own culture that I've never really shared before. One of the reasons I've never talked about this is that YC's culture was largely my creation and I didn't want to seem to be bragging. But if you understand my story, you'll understand what Y Combinator really is.&nbsp;Y Combinator is two things: it's a new structure of investment firm, but it's also a collection of people, both founders and partners. That collection of people has largely been curated by me over the last decade.</p><p>My cofounders Paul, Robert and Trevor are amazing at judging technical ideas, but as they'd be the first to admit, they're not as good judges of character. That's my department. For some reason I've always been a good judge of character–even as a little kid. So during the history of YC, for the most part they judged the ideas, and I judged the people. My cofounders called me \"the social radar\" for what seemed to them my uncanny ability to see through fakers and sociopaths. But it has historically been very important in making YC what it is.</p><p>\n<b>Interviews</b>\n</p><div>        <div>\n          <div>\n                    <p>\n          <img src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1354012/WGmmV8oZpeKuGdiPEHM0S2nzhSQ/medium_Weebly_interview.jpeg\">\n        </p>\n\n          </div>\n          \n        </div>\n<div>\n<br>The last step in YC's funding decisions is an in-person interview with YC partners. Now we have 5 interview tracks, so I only see about 20% of the applicants. But for the first 6 years we had a single interview track, and I was always part of it. In fact my cofounders respected my opinions about character so much that it would not be far off to say that I had a veto over funding decisions.<p>Most of the people we interviewed didn't realize that, because I don't usually say much during interviews. &nbsp;What I do during interviews is watch. The typical interview consisted of my cofounders peppering the applicants with technical questions, while I watched how they responded. Most applicants barely realized I was there. But after they walked out, my partners would usually turn to me to get my read on the applicants as people.</p><p>I didn't always understand the details of the questions they'd been asked and to this day I can't tell you about operating systems or distributed databases, but I can tell things like when people are BSing, how tough they are, if they get along, and surprisingly often, considering I only have 10 minutes to observe them, whether they're good people or not.</p><p>As I said, Paul, Robert and Trevor are really good at technical stuff, but it's precisely because they're so good that they often misjudged founders as people. They'd get excited talking to the applicants about all the things they could do, and afterward think the interview went well, when sometimes all the applicants did was reflect their own ideas back at them. But it was second nature to me to notice these things.&nbsp;</p><p>It's obvious why we'd want to fund founders who are knowledgeable and determined. &nbsp;But I also found myself filtering for character. This was not a deliberate decision. I just have a very intense reaction to people I think have bad characters.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Y Combinator, character had not traditionally been an important factor for investors. &nbsp;Investors have often funded people who were jerks but who seemed likely to succeed. But I couldn't do it. YC is not just an investment firm. It's like a family in that we're inviting these people into our place to have dinner every week.</p><p>But while this innovation was unintentional, or at least involuntary, it turned out to be super valuable for Y Combinator. As YC has grown, an increasing amount of the value is in the alumni network. Now there are over 2000 alumni. And the fact that we've filtered out most of the bad people means that they're almost all nurturing and trustworthy when newly funded YC companies approach them. Starting a startup has traditionally been a lonely business. Imagine what it means for there to be literally 2000 people who'll come to your aid if asked.</p><p>We continue to filter for character even now when we have 5 interview tracks, because now this has become part of YC's culture. And while we have of course made some mistakes, for the most part when you meet a YC founder, you're meeting someone you can trust. They say that institutions are the shadows of the founders, and that aspect of YC is part of my shadow.</p></div>\n\n<div>\n<b>Atmosphere</b><p>Another area where I had a big effect is the atmosphere at Y Combinator. Before YC, atmosphere was not something investment firms even had. They just had portfolios. &nbsp;But YC was different because after selecting founders we brought them together for dinner every week.</p><p>There is a very distinct atmosphere at Y Combinator dinners. If I had to put it into words I'd use words like cheery, collegial, supportive, energizing. But it's one of those things that's so remarkable it's hard to put into words. Stripe founder Patrick Collison once said that one of the best things about YC was:</p><blockquote>\n<i>the buzz of walking into Y Combinator on Tuesday evening, and the&nbsp;</i><i>general energy/excitement of the founders. That's what comes to&nbsp;</i><i>mind for me when I think of YC, and it's what I describe to others&nbsp;</i><i>when they ask why they should do YC.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<br>The atmosphere at YC dinners today is the direct descendant of the atmosphere at the very first dinners we held, back in the summer of 2005. There were only 8 companies then. I did the grocery shopping and Paul did all the cooking, and our first headquarters was in a building Paul owned and had been using as his office, so it felt as if we were inviting people over to our house each week. We had a fireplace at the office and I'd sometimes build a fire. I'd also splurge on fancy cheeses from a nearby gourmet cheese shop. It was basically a dinner party for friends.<p>This feeling has inevitably been diluted as Y Combinator has grown. There are 116 startups in the current YC batch, and YC now has its own 12,000 square-foot building, so it can't feel quite as much as if founders are coming over to our house for dinner. But it still feels a lot more intimate than you would imagine an event for 116 companies could ever be.</p><p>One of the reasons it still feels like home is that the same architect who made our first headquarters has done every space since: Kate Courteau. She's part of the family and she knows we want to keep that family feeling. It's amazing what's she's been able to achieve. You walk into our new building and it simultaneously feels magnificent and homey.</p><p>Paul once wrote an essay called \"<a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ds.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://paulgraham.com/ds.html\">Do Things that Don't Scale.</a>\" The idea is that even if you want to be big, when you're small you should give your customers a level of attention you can only give them when you're small. This will set your standards for customer service very high, and you'll be able to maintain those standards better than you'd expect as you grow.</p><p>We followed our own advice at YC, and one of the most important things we did that didn't scale was to treat the founders as if they were family. It was easy to do that during the first batch. There were so few founders. Plus in the beginning the founders were mostly young, because they were the only ones who'd apply to something like YC. So we literally felt like their parents. I knew where everyone was from, what was going on in their lives, and worried about stuff like whether they were getting enough vitamins in their diet.</p><p>Perhaps even more importantly, we did not expect those startups to make money. YC has been so successful since then that it's hard for people to realize, but the first batch of startups we funded was just for us to learn how to be investors. We quickly realized that funding startups in batches was a great idea and that we should do all our investing that way, but the first batch was just an experiment that we expected to lose money on. And since we thought of that first batch as a sort of nonprofit social project, it&nbsp;affected the way we acted toward the founders. It was natural for us when advising companies just to ask \"what's best for the founders?\" Even our original investment paperwork was novel in how founder-friendly the terms were. We didn't ask for the sort of special powers investors usually ask for, and still don't.</p><p>This is one of those counterintuitive things about startups, but one of the keys to being successful is not to be too immediately driven by money. Mark Zuckerberg is a good example. If he'd been driven by money, he'd have taken Yahoo's billion dollar acquisition offer back in 2006, and you would probably not even recognize his name.</p><p>After we saw how much it helped founders to have colleagues, we decided to do all our investing in batches. And gradually we started to have hopes that YC would make money. But by this time the idea of treating founders like family and putting their interests first had become part of YC's culture. And while it's harder to make 116 startups feel like family than 8, there's still a lot of that feeling.</p><p>It might seem impossible for a group of over 2000 alumni to feel like family, but you'd be surprised at how much it does. And while this will inevitably seem corny, to the extent it does feel like a family, I'm its mom.</p></div>\n\n<p>\n<b>Advice</b>\n</p>\n\n<div>        <div>\n          <div>\n                    <p>\n          <img src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1350064/EQF0SIoeD-2GFf6BFyPovEKaS-o/medium_30.jpg\">\n        </p>\n\n          </div>\n          \n        </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>Y Combinator doesn't end after Demo Day. The dinners end then, but we continue helping the startups for years after that. &nbsp;We still give advice to startups we funded 5 or even 8 years ago.<p>Startups need different types of advice. Sometimes they're trying to figure out what to build, or how to grow. Other times they're dealing with more personal problems like whether to take an acquisition offer or whether they should fire an employee who isn't working out. Those are the questions I tend to give advice about. Being the \"social radar\" helps me get to the root of problems within startups just as it helps me to evaluate founders during interviews.</p><p>Let me tell you something about startups. If you've ever started or worked for one, you're probably familiar with this phenomenon, but many people who haven't are surprised by it. Most startups, behind the scenes, are shitshows. Even the most successful ones.&nbsp;They mostly conceal this from the outside world, because they're trying to seem legit so they can get customers. But there are always disasters happening. I'd say around 10% of startups have life-threatening cofounder disputes, for example.</p><p>So though this tends to be concealed from the world, the sort of problems I help founders with are probably both more common and more dangerous than technical ones.</p><p>On top of my \"social radar,\" I now have experience dealing with literally hundreds of startups. So now when I see a problem I've usually seen the same problem ten times before. It must seem to founders that I'm a mind-reader, but what's really happening is that their problems are less unique than they think.</p><p>One of the most important things I know is how much to worry. Having dealt with hundreds of startups, I can look at a problem and tell founders immediately either \"Don't worry, these are typical growing pains,\" or \"you are now operating in failure mode and I have no hope for the company.\" And I think people trust that I'm not going to judge them the way some of their other investors might; they know I just want to help.</p><p>Beyond giving practical advice, though, I think it helps founders just to have someone they can talk to. All people need someone to talk to, and early on, companies are people.</p></div>\n<div>\n<br><b>Outreach</b><p>Though we can't fund every startup, we do make an effort to open-source as much as we can of what we do for the companies we fund.</p><p>For example, we try to host events that share the same kind of information that's shared at YC. And we are one of the few organizations that has always done the events for free, since we know startup founders don't often have a lot of money to spend on conferences.</p><p>Now there is a group of us who work on events, but in the beginning I used to do these events singlehandedly. And we were remarkably ambitious about them. &nbsp;We did our first Startup School in the fall of 2005, when YC was only 6 months old and our portfolio consisted of 8 companies.</p></div>\n\n<div>        <div>\n          <div>\n                    <p>\n          <img src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1350065/KVbneBLNCTX7RIUg9Yknj_XVh8w/medium_SUS_Audience.JPG\">\n        </p>\n\n          </div>\n          \n        </div>\n<br>In addition to events, we've created and open-sourced several types of investment documents, like the <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/\" target=\"_blank\">safe</a>, to make it easier and less expensive for startups to get funding.<p>Paul Graham has written <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/articles.htmlhttp://\" target=\"_blank\">lots of essays</a> on helpful subjects for startups–many of which originated from advice he gave at YC. Sam Altman now writes a ton of <a href=\"http://blog.samaltman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">great stuff</a>, too. And Kat Manalac and I launched the <a href=\"http://www.femalefounderstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://www.femalefounderstories.com/\">Female Founder Stories site</a> as a way to inspire and educate women about startups.</p></div>\n<div>\n<br>We can't advise or meet with everyone, but we have always had a philosophy of sharing as much of what YC does with the world as we can.<p>This is far from a complete list of the things I've worked on for the past 10 years, but you can see there's a lot to culture. &nbsp;Culture is not just a mission statement. &nbsp;It's which people you have in your organization, how you act within it, and even how you act to the outside world. And I can tell you from my own experience how important culture is. &nbsp;When outsiders talk about YC, they talk about its novel structure. But that's only half of what YC is. The other half is our people and culture. That's what I've focused on for the last decade, and that's the half of YC that no one else has been able to duplicate.</p></div>\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<footer>\n\n</footer>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><div lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><br>\n<i>For current implementation details, see <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK/git-annex_implementation\" title=\"INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK/git-annex implementation\" target=\"_blank\">INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK/git-annex_implementation</a>.</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>The wonder of the <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Internet_Archive\" title=\"Internet Archive\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Archive</a>'s petabytes of stored data is that they're a world treasure, providing access to a mass of information and stored culture, gathered from decades of history (in some case, centuries), and available in a (relatively) easy to find fashion. And as media and popular websites begin to cover the Archive's mission in earnest, the audience is growing notably. \n</p><p>In each wave of interest, two questions come forward out of the accolades: What is the disaster recovery plan? And why is it in only one place?\n</p><p>The disaster recovery plan is variant but generally reliant on multiple locations for the data, and it is in one place because the fundraising and support methods so far can only provide a certain amount of disaster/backup plans.\n</p><p>Therefore, it is time for Archive Team to launch its most audacious project yet: Backing up the Internet Archive.\n</p>\n<h2> <span> WELL THAT IS SERIOUSLY FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE </span></h2>\n<p>That is a very natural and understandable reaction. Before we go further, let us quickly cover some facts about the Archive's datastores.\n</p>\n<ul><li> Internet Archive has roughly 21 petabytes of unique data at this juncture. (It grows daily.)\n</li><li> Some of that is more critical and disaster-worrisome than others. (Web crawls versus TV.)\n</li><li> Some of that is disconnected/redundant data.\n</li><li> A lot of it, the vast, vast majority, is extremely static, and meant to live forever.\n</li><li> A lot of it are \"derives\", and marked as such - files that were derived from other files.\n</li></ul>\n<p>Obviously, numbers need to run, but it's less than 20 petabytes, and ultimately, <i>20 petabytes isn't that much</i>\n</p><p>Ultimately, 20 petabytes is 42,000 500gb chunks. 500gb drives are not expensive. People are throwing a lot of them out. And, obviously, we have drives of 1tb, 2tb, even 6tb, which are multiple amounts of \"chunks\".\n</p><p>The vision I have, is this: A reversal, of sorts, of <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=ArchiveBot\" title=\"ArchiveBot\" target=\"_blank\">ArchiveBot</a> - a service that allows people to provide hard drive space and hard drives, such that they can volunteer to be part of a massive Internet Archive \"virtual drive\" that will hold multiple (yes multiple) copies of the Internet Archive. \n</p>\n<h2> <span> THE PHILOSOPHY </span></h2>\n<p>There is an effort called LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) at Stanford <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lockss.org/\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a> which is meant to provide as many tools and opportunities to save digital data as easily and quickly as possible. At Google, I've been told, they try for at least five copies of data stored in at least three physical locations. This is meant to provide a similar situation for the Internet Archive.\n</p><p>While this is kind of nutty and can be considered a strange ad-hoc situation, I believe that, given the opportunity to play a part in non-geographically-dependent copies of the Internet Archive, many folks will step forward, and we will have a good solution until the expensive \"good\" solution comes along. Also, it is a very nice statement of support.\n</p>\n<h2> <span> THE IMPLEMENTATION </span></h2>\n<p>In this, there is an ArchiveBot-like service that keeps track of \"The Drive\", the backup of the Internet Archive. This \"Drive\" has sectors that are a certain size, preferably 500gb but smaller amounts might make sense. The \"items\" being backed up are Internet Archive items, with the derivations not included (so it will keep the uploaded .wav file but not the derived .mp3 and .ogg files). These \"sectors\" are then checked into the virtual drive, and based on if there's zero, one, two or more than two copies of the item in \"The Drive\", a color-coding is assigned. (Red, Yellow, Green). \n</p><p>For an end user, this includes two basic functions: copy, and verification.\n</p><p>In copy, you shove your drive into a USB dock or point to some filespace on your RAID or maybe even some space on your laptop's hard drive and say \"I contribute this to The Drive\". Then the client will back up your assigned items onto the drive. It will do so in a manner than maintains the data integrity, but allow your local drive or directory to have the files accessed (it should not be encrypted, in other words). Once it's done and verified, it is checked into The Drive as a known copy.\n</p><p>In verification, you will need to run the client once every period of time - after a while, say three months, your copy will be considered out of date to The Drive. If you do not check in after, say, six months, your copy will be considered stale and forgotten, and The Drive will lose a copy. (This is part of why you want at least two copies out there.\n</p><p>Copy and Verification are end-user experiences, so they will initially have bumps, but over time, the Drive will have copies everywhere, around the world, in laptops and stacks of drives in closets, and in the case of what will be considered \"high availability\" items, the number of copies could be in the dozens or hundreds, ensuring fast return if a disaster hits.\n</p>\n<h2> <span> CONCERNS </span></h2>\n<p>More people can add concerns, but my main one is preparing against Bad Actors, where someone might mess with their copy of the sector of The Drive that they have. Protections and checks will have to be put in to make sure the given backups are in good shape. There will always be continued risk, however, and hence the \"high availability\" items where there will be lots of copies to \"vote\". NOTE: Lots of thoughts on bad actors are on the discussion page.\n</p><p>There is also a thought about recovery - we want to be able to have the data pulled back, and that will mean a recovery system of some sort.\n</p>\n<h2> <span> STEPS TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION </span></h2>\n<p>I'd like to see us try some prototypes, with a given item set that is limited to, say, 100gb. \n</p><p>There is now a channel, <b>#internetarchive.bak</b>, on EFNet, for discussion about the implementations and testing. Of course, the discussion tab of this page is where in-process tests can be put, so people do not re-do investigations (\"Hey, what about...\") to the point of fatigue.\n</p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>",

    "title": "SpaceX Profitable as Musk Pulls In NASA Contracts, Google Cash",
    "author": "John Lippert",
    "body": "<div><section>\n    <p>     (Bloomberg) -- Investors are wondering how many years it\nwill take before Tesla makes a profit. For Elon Musk’s other big\nenterprise, SpaceX, the time is now. </p>\n<p>Space Exploration Technologies, as the closely held company\nis formally known, has contracts worth $4.2 billion for hauling\nU.S. astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station,\nand Pentagon officials say they expect to certify it soon for\nmilitary payloads. And SpaceX’s business of launching satellites\nlooks so promising that, in January, Google and Fidelity\nInvestments together invested $1 billion in the Hawthorne,\nCalifornia–based company. That gives them a 10 percent stake\nthat values SpaceX at $10 billion. Other investors include the\nFounders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners,\nand Capricorn. With 50 launches worth $5 billion on its\nmanifest, SpaceX is making money, according to its website,\nalthough a spokesman wouldn’t say how much. </p>\n<p>On Jan. 10, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape\nCanaveral, above, and successfully delivered 5,200 pounds of\nsupplies to the space station. SpaceX’s schedule includes 16\nsatellite launches in 2015, the most in the company’s 13-year\nhistory. “Google brings the applications for the satellites to\nthe table, and SpaceX has the technical know-how and the launch\ncapacity,” says Marco Caceres, director of space studies at\nconsulting firm Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. </p>\n<h2>Beaming the Internet </h2>\n<p>Google has a practical goal in linking up with SpaceX. It\nwants to beam the Internet to hard-to-reach regions of the\nplanet so it can take in more advertising revenue. “Space-based\napplications, like imaging satellites, can help people more\neasily access important information, so we’re excited to support\nSpaceX’s growth,” Google spokesman Aaron Stein said in a\nstatement. </p>\n<p>Musk’s aim is more ethereal: He wants to colonize Mars. </p>\n<p>SpaceX, which employs 4,000 people, is offering cheaper\nrocket and satellite launches than were possible when NASA and\nthe military were in charge. Musk says he can send a satellite\ninto space for $60 million. His main private competitor, United\nLaunch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing,\nspends $225 million, ULA’s website says. </p>\n<h2>Reusable Rockets </h2>\n<p>Musk’s money-saving strategy is to produce reusable\nrockets, which will return to Earth and land on a seagoing\nbarge. SpaceX called off its second attempt at a barge landing,\non Feb. 11, because of heavy seas. The company was due to try\nagain in April. “Aircraft do tens of thousands of flights,”\nMusk told Bloomberg News in January. If SpaceX rockets can be\nreused, he said, the cost comes down to “$200,000 to $300,000\nper flight in fuel and oxygen versus a $60 million rocket.” </p>\n<p>And the Mars colony? Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief\noperating officer, says the first step, manned flights to the\nplanet, could begin in 15 years. </p>\n<p>To contact the reporter on this story:\nJohn Lippert in Chicago at \n<a href=\"mailto:jlippert@bloomberg.net\" target=\"_blank\">jlippert@bloomberg.net</a> </p>\n<p>To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nMichael Serrill at \n<a href=\"mailto:mserrill@bloomberg.net\" target=\"_blank\">mserrill@bloomberg.net</a> </p>\n \n</section>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t<img src=\"http://assets2.vice.com/images/content-images/2015/03/04/the-night-my-girlfriend-forgot-who-i-was-944-body-image-1425467683.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n</p><p>\n\tThe situation, as it stood, couldn't have looked much worse. A man had cornered a tearful, terrified woman in the lobby of a block of flats and wouldn't let her leave. If another person entered at that moment, the woman would say the man was a complete stranger. She'd say she had no recollection of how she'd got here.\n</p><p>\n\tThe third person would – quite reasonably – deduce that, in all probability, the man had drugged the woman and, if they had a shred of human decency, would come to her rescue by whatever means. Maybe they'd call the police. Maybe they'd beat the shit out of him. After all, he was clearly planning to rape the woman. There was almost no explanation in which the man came out looking like a goodie. Almost.\n</p><p>\n\tI played the hypotheticals through in my head and, to a God I decided in that instant was real, I prayed. I prayed that as long as I stood there with my girlfriend in the midst of a severe dissociative episode, no other soul would appear. God, if you're reading this: I owe you one.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe were in bed early one Christmas morning when she first told me about her dissociative identity disorder (DID). At this point, our relationship was eight months old, and she'd been open about pretty much everything from the beginning – apart from this. I don't think it was so much that she was worried it'd scare me off, but that she had to know she could trust me completely with this information virtually no one else knew.\n</p><p>\n\tShe explained the condition very briefly to me – at its worst, she said, she would not only struggle to identify who she was, but even what she was; unable to process the concept of her own humanity. It caused her a great deal of pain talking about it, which I think was probably a major factor in so few people knowing. For her sake, I didn't really ask any questions or press her on it further. When she finished talking I told her it didn't change anything and that I loved her regardless. Four months later, I saw for the first time what she described.\n</p><p>\n\tThe night began with us watching a movie at a friend's place. About halfway through the film I noticed a shift in her breathing, becoming faster and shallower. This wasn't particular cause for alarm – she'd suffered severe anxiety since long before we met, and was generally pretty good at overcoming it. I rubbed her back and shoulders in an attempt to reassure her, but it gradually became more and more apparent that this panic wasn't going to shift. After about 20 minutes, she whispered in my ear: \"We have to leave. I'm about to dissociate.\"\n</p><p>\n\tWe quickly gathered our stuff and apologised to the hosts, claiming we were both just exhausted and needed to get home to sleep. Once we got out of their building she placed her hand in mine. \"Promise me that whatever happens, you will not let go,\" she said. I promised.\n</p><p>\n\tAs we walked along the street I could see it beginning to take hold; she was becoming visibly confused by her surroundings. I managed to flag down a taxi straight away. There were a few moments of good fortune that night; this was the first.\n</p><p>\n\t<img src=\"http://assets2.vice.com/images/content-images/2015/03/04/the-night-my-girlfriend-forgot-who-i-was-944-body-image-1425467825.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n</p><p>\n\tHackneyed as it sounds, the silence was eerie. This was a woman who made most extroverts look like JD Salinger, someone who could engage even the surliest of bouncers in cheery conversation and charm them enough to let her obviously underage friends into bars. And she just sat there, staring out of the window. For the first time in our relationship she was speechless.\n</p><p>\n\tI squeezed her hand and said, \"I love you.\" She looked at me blankly for a few seconds then turned back to her window. I knew I couldn't take it personally and tried to rationalise the matter – after all, it wasn't like she was mad at me and giving me the silent treatment after a fight. She simply didn't know who I was. In retrospect, it feels a little selfish that I even stopped to consider how her nightmarish ordeal was affecting me, but it was inescapable. It was a deeply and uniquely upsetting situation.\n</p><p>\n\tIn the eyes of the woman I loved, I was now a stranger. I was crushed.\n</p><p>\n\tThe last 10 minutes of the journey went by without incident. She remained calm in spite of the sheer terror she was clearly facing, for which I was (again, perhaps selfishly) grateful – I didn't fancy explaining to our driver the specifics of a condition I myself knew next to nothing about. I had just enough cash for the fare when we pulled up outside her apartment building, another tiny but glorious stroke of luck.\n</p><p>\n\tI opened my door and, careful to not let go of her hand, awkwardly manoeuvred myself out and pulled her with me. We crossed the road, walked through the courtyard and through the front door into the lobby of her building. This was when things got difficult.\n</p><p>\n\tI guess, up to this point, we'd been in public, and the presence of the taxi driver would have provided a certain level of reassurance. Now she was alone with a man she had, to her knowledge, never met before. And while it was her building we were entering, this too was unfamiliar in her current state of mind. Although she was able to identify that she was dissociating, she had no idea how she got here. If you've ever tried to lead someone back to their tent while they're K-holing, it was a little like that, only amplified to a whole other level.\n</p><p>\n\t<img src=\"http://assets2.vice.com/images/content-images/2015/03/04/the-night-my-girlfriend-forgot-who-i-was-944-body-image-1425467844.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n</p><p>\n\tPicture the situation: a relatively small woman suddenly becomes aware she is inside a building she doesn't recognise with a strange man who is significantly larger than she is. She did what any woman would do in that situation: ran, pulling her hand out of mine and making for the door. I was surprised by my reaction as instinct kicked in and I leapt after her, wrapping my arms around her waist and lifting her away from the exit.\n</p><p>\n\tPhysically restraining a distressed woman, it turns out, is not an action that says, \"No, really, you're safe with me,\" but I had no other choice. Had I let her run out at night into streets she couldn't possibly navigate, she could have faced serious, life-threatening danger. I placed her in a corner and stood a few feet back, acting as a barrier between my girlfriend and the door. I spoke softly and raised my hands, the universally-accepted body language for, \"Seriously, I'm chill.\"\n</p><p>\n\tShe cowered in the corner. \"If you come one step closer, I'll scream,\" she warned me. I stayed put. It was then the hypotheticals entered my head. As we already know, whether by sheer good luck or act of god, we remained alone. Helpful as this was, it didn't change the fact I was still standing in a lobby with a woman who had no idea who I was and wouldn't let me take her to her flat.\n</p><p>\n\t\"You have your phone on you, don't you?\" I asked her. She looked into her bag and nodded. \"Do you know who George is?\" She nodded again. George was an ex-boyfriend, one of her oldest friends, and the only person outside of her immediate family, doctor and me who knew about her condition. As someone who'd been in her life significantly longer than me, she had more memories attached to him and so hadn't forgotten who he was. \"Call George,\" I said.\n</p><p>\n\t'This is perfectly normal,' I thought, as she scrolled through her phone looking for George's name. 'I'm just a guy, standing here, getting my girlfriend's ex to vouch for my existence.'\n</p><p>\n\tHer first attempt went through to voicemail. Quietly and tearfully, all she could say was \"help me\" a dozen or so times. I wondered if he was at work. It could have been hours before he was able to check his phone. In our last stroke of good fortune for the night, he called back a few seconds later. I can't remember exactly what was said or how long they talked for; it might have been a minute, it might have been five. She mentioned that there was a man here she didn't know who was claiming to be her boyfriend, and in a sort of exaggerated stage whisper I said, \"George! It's me!\"\n</p><p>\n\t<img src=\"http://assets2.vice.com/images/content-images/2015/03/04/the-night-my-girlfriend-forgot-who-i-was-944-body-image-1425467859.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n</p><p>\n\tShe listened for a little while longer and then passed the phone to me. \"He wants to talk to you.\" I spoke to George for a couple of minutes. I've never been so relieved to hear the voice of a girlfriend's ex. He calmly talked me through the next steps – to get her into her flat, sit her down and pull up something she'd seen before on Netflix. Familiarity was key, he told me. I thanked him and returned the phone. They talked for a few more seconds, then she hung up.\n</p><p>\n\t\"George says I can trust you.\"\n</p><p>\n\tI took her by the hand once more and led her up the stairs.\n</p><p>\n\tOnce we were inside her flat, things got easier. I closed the door behind us and she immediately sat down on the wooden floor and told me her feet hurt. I helped her take off her shoes and then pulled her up, before walking her round the room, pointing out the framed photos on her wall and asking if she recognised the people in them. \"That's me!\" she said cheerily. \"And that's George!\" This helped a lot.\n</p><p>\n\tIn the space of a few minutes the dynamic of our relationship had shifted from one of me as her would-be attacker to a bizarrely paternal thing. As her boyfriend, both of these were a little odd, but at least with the latter she was no longer afraid. For the rest of the night we watched TV together while I waited for the woman I loved to return.\n</p><p>\n\t<img src=\"http://assets2.vice.com/images/content-images/2015/03/04/the-night-my-girlfriend-forgot-who-i-was-944-body-image-1425467879.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n</p><p>\n\tA few hours after she first told me, I took some time to read up on dissociative identity disorder. As with many mental illnesses, there's a lot of speculation and theory surrounding the condition, which is understandable when you comprehend what a convoluted labyrinth the human mind is. However, DID \n\t<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18569730\" target=\"_blank\">is</a><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18569730\" target=\"_blank\"> considered</a> \"probably the most disputed of psychiatric diagnoses\", with \"no clear consensus regarding its diagnosis or treatment\".\n</p><p>\n\tIt's a rare condition, but one that crops up in popular culture a huge amount. If you've not heard of DID before (I hadn't), you probably know it as multiple personality disorder, to which it was formerly referred. Its representations in fiction are often quite harmful, with multiple personalities frequently portrayed as good versus evil, such as in Jekyll and Hyde. As with schizophrenia and other conditions, sufferers are often portrayed as murderous sociopaths – when the reality is they're far more vulnerable to being attacked.\n</p><p>\n\tMany people suffering from DID report sexual or physical abuse in childhood, which has led some researchers to believe that DID is a reaction to trauma. I already knew that, growing up, my girlfriend had repeatedly been beaten by her father, so it's likely this played a part in her condition. Another hypothesis suggests that DID is caused by therapists \"recovering\" memories from patients that then cause them to behave a certain way – but this didn't apply to my girlfriend.\n</p><p>\n\tFor her, the episodes occur sporadically; she could go months or years without suffering one, but they could also happen several times in a relatively short time span. They almost always happened in times of extreme stress. She'd later tell me that dissociative episodes happened when her brain was unable to cope with the stress, so it would essentially remove itself from her body for a short period of time to give her a break.\n</p>§<p>\n\t<br>\n\tAbout three hours into the episode, I could see a few faint glimmers of her personality reappearing. She recognised a favourite character and a grin spread across her face. A little while later I asked if she knew who I was. \"I know you,\" she said. \"I love you.\" It meant a lot to hear those words.\n</p><p>\n\tWhen we finally got into bed that night she fell asleep instantly, emotionally and physically exhausted. She'd wake up with no memory of what had happened, and wouldn't want to know. I lay awake a little while and wondered if there's anything more terrifying than the human mind.\n</p><p>\n\tI doubt there is.\n</p><p>\n\t<a href=\"https://instagram.com/markduffyphoto/\" target=\"_blank\"></a><em><a href=\"https://instagram.com/markduffyphoto/\" target=\"_blank\">@markduffyphoto</a></em>\n</p><p>\n\t<em>More from VICE:</em>\n</p><p>\n\t<em><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/this-is-what-developing-acute-schizophrenia-is-like-009\" target=\"_blank\">This Is What Developing Acute Schizophrenia Feels Like</a></em>\n</p><p>\n\t<em><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/mental-health-disability-benefits-sanction-092\" target=\"_blank\">Meeting People with Mental Health Problems Who Have Had Their Benefits Snatched Away</a></em>\n</p><p>\n\t<em><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/james-nolan-intellectually-disability-734\" target=\"_blank\">What My Uncle Has Taught Me About Having an Intellectual Disability</a></em>\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n\t<div>\n\t After 16 years of doing a bit of everything under the sun here, I’m stepping away from the day to day of running MetaFilter and moving into the background. Never fear, I’m leaving it in the best of hands and things are looking good for the future. \n     <p>\n     <br>\n\t\n\t<strong>The short version:</strong></p><ul><li>Metafilter is staying the same, with the same team of moderators</li>\n<li>I’ll no longer being doing day-to-day moderating or operations or drawing a paycheck, but I’m still the site’s owner and will be available in a background capacity</li>\n<li>cortex is taking on the primary managerial and operational duties for the site in addition to moderating</li>\n<li>LobsterMitten is returning as a full-time moderator</li>\n<li>Site finances are steady and have improved somewhat over the last few months</li></ul>\n\n<strong>The long version:</strong><br>\n<br>\nIn the Fall of 1998, I had the first ideas and urge to build my own blogging system. I started reading programming books and attended an intense 3-day seminar and came out of it building basic web apps. By March of 1999, MetaFilter had a name and a community concept and I was building it in earnest. In June it was pretty much ready to go and after another month of testing it saw the light of day in July of that year.<br>\n<br>\nSince those beginnings the site has grown in every way, and all along the way grown a bit more complex with each passing year. We’ve added half a dozen specialized subsites and watched the membership swell by the tens of thousands while millions of general internet users visited each month. Together we've built an amazing community, both the pioneering pre-$5 members and the people who have continued to join through the years.<br>\n<br>\nBut for the last few years, the site has had some extreme ups and downs, and that has resulted in a roller coaster of stress for me personally. A couple years ago my anxiety and stress bubbled up to the point where I wasn’t eating and sleeping regularly. To remedy this, I took the #1 advice of Ask MetaFilter and saw a therapist. This helped me process incoming stressors and realize much of my worries were unfounded and in my head, but over the course of a year of sessions I began to learn a lot about myself. One of the things that became apparent was I’m not cut out for the entrepreneur lifestyle--I don’t eat up risk &amp; stress and shit out innovation--instead I tend to worry about every aspect of every little thing and get caught up on any setbacks.<br>\n<br>\nIn the last year, stress has played a central role in my life as we had to downsize and restructure MetaFilter. In the aftermath, I returned to a full-time role of moderation duties in addition to the feature development, advertising, planning, feedback/support, and operations aspects of running a company. While it was good to curtail costs at MeFi in order to secure the future of the site, by putting myself into an additional role I eventually realized I was taking on more work than I was up to handling and after several months the cracks started to show. I began making mistakes and the mistakes were growing bigger. There are a few 1,000+ comment threads in MetaTalk over the last few months that launched as a direct result of some ham-fisted decision I made in the moment without properly thinking it through, and I’ve felt for months I have been doing a subpar job explaining moderator actions to members.<br>\n<br>\nLate last year, I started to acknowledge to myself that I was hitting some limits and after 16 years I was starting to really burn out. I tried taking a few days off here and there and avoiding the site on days I wasn’t doing moderation work, but every time I returned, the stress returned. Every morning I’d wake up and glance at my phone with some sense of dread worrying about what was waiting in my inbox.  <br>\n<br>\nA couple months ago, while I was going through all the stages of grief in my head over the absolute burnout I was facing and wondering what to do about MetaFilter and whatever might be next in my life, a couple companies contacted me asking if I would ever consider joining their teams. I’ve fielded these kinds of requests in the past, and it’s always thrilling when someone contacts you out of the blue and wants you, but it’s tough to find a company you love that makes products you love that also wants you to join their team on terms that work for everybody. I talked to some folks and explored options and in the process I came away with lots to think about. I started to see light at the end of the tunnel, and thought this might be the best way forward for both me and the site.<br>\n<br>\nI talked to the team at MeFi, stating plainly my reasons, and we came up with a plan. cortex is taking on the bulk of my managerial and operations roles as an expansion of his responsibilities; LobsterMitten is returning immediately to full-time moderation to take over my mod hours; and everyone on the team will be pitching in a bit more to help shape the site, the moderation, and the community’s future. I will transition immediately into more of a background role (cue the “retired” tag in MetaTalk!) as I venture out into another gig.<br>\n<br>\nIn this configuration, moderation improves immediately as LobsterMitten steps into the mix, and the whole team has been discussing areas of improvement they are working toward. cortex is looking forward to the added tasks of day-to-day monitoring, which will go a long way towards minimizing my stress and my role. For members, nothing will change, except the mod team and where the buck stops for most site matters.  For me, I’ll shut off all the emails the server regularly sends me but stay on for podcasts and regular monthly “grand vision” type meetings to touch base on big picture things. I’m definitely looking forward to enjoying MeFi as a member and user for the first time, as all the mods continue doing the great job they have been of keeping my favorite community afloat and prospering in my absence. While I will still own MeFi, I am mostly removing myself financially from it, and no longer drawing a salary. Right now, between ad revenue and the help of members supporting the site, we’re operating at a small profit each month and building up savings; your support has been instrumental in keeping the site running and putting it on a good foundation for the future.<br>\n<br>\nIt’s been a long, crazy road, and I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart, for everyone that has joined the site, participates via every post and comment, attends meetups, and helps make this place great. Thanks also to everyone that contributed funds last year (and still to this day!) when our future wasn’t so bright; you literally help keep the lights on. I have spent nearly half my life working on MetaFilter and I’m proud of my work here and glad I did it, and I’m thankful for the great and supportive staff that are taking the reins and letting me step down.\n     <p></p>\n     \n\t<span>posted by <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/user/1\" target=\"_blank\">mathowie</a> to <a href=\"http://metatalk.metafilter.com/meta-meta\" target=\"_blank\">MetaFilter-Related</a> at 1:03 PM (24 comments total) \t\n\t\n<span><a href=\"http://metatalk.metafilter.com/favorited/5/23626\" target=\"_blank\">9 users marked this as a favorite</a></span>\n\n</span></div></div>",

    "body": "<div><div>\n<p>Have you ever been on a pentest, or troubleshooting a customer issue, and the \"next step\" was to capture packets on a Windows host?&nbsp; Then you find that installing winpcap or wireshark was simply out of scope or otherwise not allowed on that SQL, Exchange, Oracle or other host?&nbsp; It used to be that this is when we'd recommend installing Microsoft's Netmon packet capture utility, but even then lots of IT managers would hesitate about using the \"install\" word in association with a critical server.&nbsp;

In 2014, Etsy\nsellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, of which 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% came from an Etsy seller or an Etsy buyer outside of the United States. </p>\n<p>Our community is the heart and soul of Etsy. Our community is made up of creative entrepreneurs who sell on our platform, thoughtful consumers looking to buy\nunique goods in our marketplace, responsible manufacturers who help Etsy sellers grow their businesses and Etsy employees who maintain our platform and nurture our ecosystem. </p>\n<p>Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money. Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace\nactivities and the services we provide Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she\nlists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via\nShipping Labels. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. </p> <p>In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion,\nup 43.3% over 2013. In 2014, we generated revenue of $195.6 million, up 56.4% over 2013. In 2014, we generated a net loss of $15.2&nbsp;million and Adjusted EBITDA of $23.1&nbsp;million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of\n$16.9 million in 2013. See “Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure\ncalculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. </p> <p>Our Values </p>\n<p><i>We are a mindful, transparent and humane business.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that business interests and social and environmental responsibility are\ninterwoven and aligned and that the power of business should be used to strengthen communities and empower people. </p> <p><i>We plan and build for the long\nterm.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to build a company that lasts, and we plan to measure our success in years and decades. Etsy sellers in particular depend on us and on our platform to grow their businesses, so we will strive to make decisions that are\nbest for the long-term health of our ecosystem. </p> <p><i>We value craftsmanship in all we make.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Craftsmanship is the marriage of skill and\npassion. We believe every job at our company should demonstrate our commitment to craft. We are an engineering-driven company, and we think of our code as craft: we are makers of the products and services that our members use, and we approach the\nwork we do with the same care and inspiration as do Etsy sellers. </p>\n </div></div>\n\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n<div><div>\n\n <p><i>We believe fun should be part of everything we do.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mission includes fostering a world\nin which personal fulfillment is a key element of success. We believe that this way of working is connected and joyful. We strive to do excellent work and bring a sense of humor and playfulness to it. </p>\n<p><i>We keep it real, always.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the courage and the will to do business in ways that are unconventional and impactful. We strive to stay\ngenuine, maintaining integrity, humility and sincerity in everything we do. When we feel that we are not being true to our values or our mission, we are not afraid to stop and change course. </p>\n<p>Our Opportunity </p> <p>We operate at the center of several\nconverging macroeconomic trends in online and mobile commerce, employment, consumption and manufacturing. We believe that in combination these trends will benefit millions of people in our ecosystem around the world: Etsy sellers engaging in their\ncreative passion, working for themselves and defining success on their own terms; Etsy buyers accessing a diverse, global marketplace of goods that have historically been found in highly fragmented markets; and, increasingly, responsible\nmanufacturers using modern tools to craft goods in partnership with Etsy sellers. </p> <p><i>Trends in Online and Mobile Commerce.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Etsy sellers\noffer goods in dozens of online retail categories, including jewelry, stationery, clothing, home goods, craft supplies and vintage items. Euromonitor, a consumer market research company, estimated that the global online retail market was $695\nbillion in 2013, up from $280 billion in 2008, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 19.9%. This growth is expected to continue, with the global online retail market becoming a significantly larger portion of the total retail\nmarket, reaching $1.5 trillion by 2018, implying a 16.6% CAGR from 2013. Mobile commerce is also increasingly important in online retail. comScore estimated that since the first quarter of 2013, consumers visiting online commerce sites spent more\nthan half of their browsing time on mobile devices; however, online commerce spending via mobile devices represented only 11% of total online commerce dollars in the third quarter of 2014. </p>\n<p><i>Trends in Employment.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether motivated by economic necessity or personal preference, a growing number of people are turning to\nself-employment for their livelihoods. In a 2012 survey of middle-class households in the United States by the Pew Research Center, 85% said that it was more difficult to maintain their living standards today than it was ten years ago. A study\ncommissioned in July 2014 by the Freelancers Union and Elance-oDesk estimated that 53&nbsp;million Americans are working as freelancers. Women are also contributing to the trend towards self-employment. World Bank research shows that, in certain\ndeveloping nations, over half of the women in the labor force are self-employed. We believe that many of these people have creative skills that could provide a foundation for entrepreneurship, but that they often have little or no experience running\ntheir own businesses, and they typically lack the marketing resources, the technological expertise and the manufacturing and logistics capabilities to turn their creativity into a business. </p>\n </div></div>\n\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n<div><div>\n\n <p><i>Trends in Consumption.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most large retailers today follow the same formula, emphasizing\nefficiency and scale and pressuring their suppliers to reduce their costs in order to serve mass-produced goods at the lowest-possible prices. We believe, however, that many consumers want to purchase goods that are unique and that reflect their\npersonality and style, not simply mass-produced, generic goods. Some consumers want their purchases to reflect their values; they want to support retailers and suppliers that have responsible and sustainable policies toward their employees, their\ncommunities and the environment. Finding these goods can be difficult, as markets for such goods have historically been highly fragmented across boutiques, consignment stores and other venues and marketplaces. </p>\n<p><i>Trends in Manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Because of advances in manufacturing technologies, individuals and small businesses now have the ability to\nmanufacture goods in their homes and studios using tools such as computer-assisted design, 3D printers, computer-controlled routers and other machines at a fraction of the historical cost. We believe the decrease in the size and the cost of these\ntools will make it easier for creative entrepreneurs to start new businesses. We also believe that small-batch manufacturers will be able to use these new technologies to provide high-quality manufacturing services so that creative entrepreneurs can\nscale their own businesses. </p> <p>Our Strengths </p> <p>Our platform\nconnects millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers globally, making it one of the largest online marketplaces in the world.

As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $32.4&nbsp;million. We may not achieve or maintain profitability in the\nfuture.

These efforts may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses.

For example, our historical growth may have overshadowed the seasonal effects on\nour historical operating results.

Likewise, our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported B Corporation score declines. B Lab, an independent, third-party organization, sets the standards for Certified B Corporation certification and\nmay change those standards over time. </p> <p><b>Our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active community of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers.\n</b></p> <p>In order to increase revenue and to achieve and maintain profitability, we must attract new members and retain existing members. We must also\nencourage Etsy sellers to list items for sale and use our Seller Services and encourage Etsy buyers to purchase items in our marketplace. </p> <p>We believe\nthat many of our new members find Etsy by word of mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing members. If existing Etsy sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform, they may stop listing items in our marketplace and may stop\nreferring others to us. Likewise, if existing Etsy buyers do not find our platform appealing, whether because of a negative experience, lack of buyer-friendly features, declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by Etsy sellers or other\nfactors, they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us. Under these circumstances, we may have difficulty attracting new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers without incurring additional marketing expense. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Even if we are able to attract new members to replace members we lose, they may not maintain the same level of\nactivity and the revenue generated from new members may not be as high as the revenue generated from the lost members. If we are unable to retain existing members and attract new members who contribute to an active community, our growth prospects\nwould be harmed and our business could be adversely affected. </p> <p><b>Further expansion into markets outside of the United States is important to the growth\nof our business but will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad. </b></p> <p>Expanding our community into markets outside of the United States is\nan important part of our strategy. Although we have a significant number of members outside of the United States, we have limited experience in developing local markets outside the United States. The nature of the goods that Etsy sellers list in our\nmarketplace may not appeal to non-U.S. consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the United States. Also, visits to our marketplace from Etsy buyers outside the United States may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the\nUnited States. Our success in markets outside the United States will be linked to our ability to attract local Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to our platform. If we are not able to do so, our growth prospects could be harmed. </p>\n<p>In addition, competition is likely to intensify in the international markets where we operate and plan to expand our operations. Local companies based in\nmarkets outside the United States may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, those local markets. Some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow in international markets more\nquickly than we will. </p> <p>Continued expansion in markets outside of the United States will also require significant financial investment. These investments\ninclude marketing to attract and retain new members, developing localized services, forming relationships with third-party service providers, supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the United\nStates and integrating those companies with our operations. </p> <p>Doing business in markets outside of the United States also subjects us to increased risks\nand burdens such as: </p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">complying with different regulatory standards (including those related to the use of personal information, particularly in the European Union); </td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">managing and staffing operations over a broader geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs; </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">adapting our platform to local cultural norms and customs; </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">potentially heightened risk of fraudulent transactions; </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">limitations on the repatriation of funds and fluctuations of foreign exchange rates; </td></tr></tbody></table>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and export control laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, trade controls and\nsanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">varying levels of Internet, e-commerce and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure; </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">our ability to enforce contracts and intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the United States; and </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">barriers to international trade, such as tariffs or other taxes. </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Etsy sellers face similar risks in\nconducting their businesses across borders. Even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders, if Etsy sellers are not, our business could be adversely affected. </p>\n<p>Finally, operating in markets outside of the United States requires significant management attention. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand\nour operations outside of the United States and cannot manage these risks effectively, the costs of doing business in those markets may be prohibitive or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets. </p>\n<p><b>We expect to increase our marketing efforts to help grow our business, but those efforts may not be effective at attracting new members and retaining\nexisting members. </b></p> <p>Maintaining and promoting awareness of our marketplace and broader platform is important to our ability to retain existing members\nand to attract new members. We believe that much of the growth in our member base to date has originated from word-of-mouth referrals and other organic means, as our historical marketing efforts and expenditures have been relatively limited. Going\nforward, we intend to invest more in marketing, with a particular focus on bringing more Etsy buyers to our platform. We anticipate that our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive as competition increases, and generating a\nmeaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult. Also, the marketing efforts we implement in the future may not succeed as we have limited marketing experience. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of these efforts, that\nadditional revenue may not offset the expenses we incur. </p> <p>Our marketing efforts currently include search engine marketing and display advertising, as\nwell as search engine optimization, social media usage, mobile “push” notifications and email. We obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!. Search engines frequently change the algorithms\nthat determine the ranking and display of results of a user’s search, and those changes can negatively affect the placement of links to our marketplace and, therefore, reduce the number of visits to our marketplace. We also obtain a significant\nnumber of visits through email advertising. If we are unable to successfully deliver emails to our members or if members do not open our emails, whether out of choice, because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected. Social networking websites, such as Facebook and Pinterest, are another important </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nsource of visits to our marketplace. As online commerce and social networking continue to evolve, we must maintain a presence within these networks. We may be unable to develop or maintain such a\npresence. </p> <p><b>Our payments system depends on third-party providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations. </b></p>\n<p>Etsy buyers can pay for purchases using Direct Checkout or PayPal. In the United States and other countries where Direct Checkout is available, Etsy buyers\ncan pay with credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers and Etsy gift cards on our platform rather than being directed to a third-party payment platform. A significant portion of our GMS is processed through Direct Checkout, and a portion of our\nrevenue is derived from Direct Checkout. </p> <p>We have engaged third-party service providers to perform underlying card processing, currency exchange,\nidentity verification and fraud analysis services. If these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to terminate, Etsy sellers’ ability to accept orders could be adversely affected\nand our business would be harmed. In addition, if these providers increase the fees they charge us, our operating expenses could increase. Alternatively, if we respond by increasing the fees we charge to Etsy sellers, some Etsy sellers may stop\nusing Direct Checkout, stop listing new items for sale or even close their accounts altogether. </p> <p>The laws and regulations related to payments are complex\nand vary across different jurisdictions in the United States and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply, or any failure by\nour third-party service providers to comply, could cost us substantial resources, could result in liabilities, or could force us to stop offering Direct Checkout. As we expand the availability of Direct Checkout or offer new payment methods to our\nmembers in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements. </p> <p>Further, through our agreement with our third-party\ncredit card processor, we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also subject to rules governing electronic funds\ntransfers. Any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. </p> <p><b>Our ability to expand our ecosystem is\nimportant to the growth of our business. </b></p> <p>We spend substantial time and resources creating new offerings in order to add new constituents to our\necosystem and to open new sales channels for Etsy sellers. For example, in October 2013, we expanded our ecosystem by allowing Etsy sellers to work with small-batch manufacturers. Additionally, in August 2014, we added traditional retailers to our\necosystem with the launch of our Wholesale offering, which allows Etsy sellers to sell their products to retailers on our platform. </p> <p>Our efforts to\nexpand our ecosystem could fail for many reasons, including lack of acceptance of our offerings by existing members or new constituents, our failure to market our offerings effectively to new constituents, defects or errors in our new offerings or\nnegative publicity about us or our new offerings. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nDiversifying our offerings and expanding our ecosystem to benefit our community involves significant risk. For example, these initiatives may not drive increases in revenue, may require\nsubstantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do. It will require additional investment of time and resources in the development and\ntraining of our personnel and our members. If we are unable to cost-effectively expand our ecosystem, then our growth prospects and competitive position may be harmed. </p>\n<p><b>We must develop new offerings to respond to our members’ changing needs. </b></p>\n<p>Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, new service and product introductions and changing customer demands. We spend substantial time\nand resources understanding our members’ needs and responding to them. For example, we are continually developing additional Seller Services, improving search and discovery functionality and enhancing the member experience. Recently, we have\nfocused on providing additional Seller Services and tools to help Etsy sellers manage and scale their businesses. For example, in August 2014, we launched our Wholesale offering. In addition, we developed a mobile app and expanded Direct Checkout to\nenable an Etsy seller in the United States to use our “Sell on Etsy Reader” to accept credit card and debit card payments in person, such as at her store or her booth at a craft fair. </p>\n<p>Our members may not be satisfied with our new offerings or perceive that the new offerings respond to their needs. Developing new offerings is complex, and\nthe timetable for commercial release is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience. As a result, the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated or announced release dates. Our new offerings also may bring us more\ndirectly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do. </p> <p>If we do not continue to cost-effectively\ndevelop new offerings that satisfy our members, then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed. In addition, new offerings may have lower margins than existing offerings and our revenue may not grow enough as a result of the new\nofferings to offset the cost of developing them. </p> <p><b>If the mobile solutions available to Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are not effective, the use of our\nplatform could decline. </b></p> <p>Visits and purchases made on mobile devices by consumers, including Etsy buyers, have increased significantly in recent\nyears. The smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or less appealing to members. Visits to our marketplace on mobile devices may not convert into purchases as\noften as visits made through personal computers, which could result in less revenue for us. Etsy sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate their businesses on our platform. If we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on\nmobile devices, Etsy sellers’ ability to manage and grow their businesses may be harmed and, consequently, our business may suffer. Further, although we strive to provide engaging mobile experiences for both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers who\nvisit our mobile website using a browser on their mobile device, we depend on Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers downloading our mobile apps to provide them the optimal mobile experience. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>As new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting\napps for them.

In general, our key personnel work for us on an at-will basis. Other companies, including our competitors, may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees, and it may be\ndifficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms. </p> <p>Filling engineering, product management and other technical\npositions in the New York City area is particularly challenging, especially in light of our distinctive technology philosophy and engineering culture. Qualified individuals are limited and in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to\nattract, develop and motivate them. Even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits, people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us. If we are not able to maintain our engineering\nculture and broader company culture, then our ability to recruit and retain employees could suffer and our business would be harmed. </p> <p><b>The growth of our\nbusiness may strain our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure. </b></p> <p>We have experienced rapid growth in our business, such as\nin headcount, the number of Etsy sellers and the number of countries in which we have members, and we plan to continue to grow in the future, both in the United States and abroad. For example, our headcount has grown from 251 employees on\nDecember&nbsp;31, 2011 to 685&nbsp;employees on December&nbsp;31, 2014, an increase of 172.9%. The growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational and financial infrastructure. As we\ncontinue to grow, our operating expenses will increase. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed. </p>\n<p>Continued growth could also pose other challenges, such as the need to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls and to enhance\nour reporting systems and procedures. For example, in 2013 we began implementing a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to enhance a variety of important functions such as invoicing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, foreign\ncurrency translation, financial consolidation and internal and external financial and management reporting matters. ERP system implementations are complex, long-term projects that involve substantial expenditures. To fully realize the benefits of\nthe new ERP system we must also make significant changes to our business and financial processes. Our business may be harmed if the ERP system does not function as expected or does not result in the expected benefits. </p>\n<p><b>We rely on Etsy sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to Etsy buyers. </b></p>\n<p>A small portion of Etsy buyers complain to us about their experience with our platform. For example, Etsy buyers may report that they have not received the\nitems that they purchased, that the items received were not as represented by an Etsy seller or that an Etsy seller has not been responsive to their questions. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nNegative publicity and member sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints could reduce our ability to attract new members or retain our current members or damage our reputation.\nA perception that our levels of responsiveness and member support are inadequate could have similar results. In some situations, we may choose to reimburse Etsy buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation, but we may not be able\nto recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements. </p> <p>Anything that disrupts the operations of a substantial number of Etsy sellers, such as\ninterruptions in delivery services, natural disasters, inclement weather, public health crises or political unrest, could also result in negative experiences for a substantial number of Etsy buyers. </p>\n<p><b>Etsy sellers rely on third-party services to deliver their orders. </b></p>\n<p>Etsy sellers work with a number of third-party services such as FedEx, UPS, the United States Postal Service and Canada Post to deliver their products to\nEtsy buyers. Anything that prevents timely delivery of goods to Etsy buyers could harm Etsy sellers and could negatively affect our reputation. Delays or interruptions may be caused by events that are beyond the control of the delivery services,\nsuch as inclement weather, natural disasters, transportation disruptions, terrorism, public health crises or labor unrest. For example, certain delivery services were reported to have been overwhelmed by the volume of shipments during the 2013\nholiday season, resulting in significant delays in delivery times. The delivery services could also be affected by industry consolidation, insolvency or government shut-downs. Although we have agreements with certain delivery services that enable us\nto provide pre-paid shipping labels as a convenience to Etsy sellers, our agreements do not require these providers to offer delivery services to Etsy sellers. Further, our competitors could obtain preferential rates or shipping services, causing\nEtsy sellers to pay higher shipping costs or find alternative delivery services. If the goods sold in our marketplace are not delivered in proper condition, on a timely basis or at shipping rates that Etsy buyers are willing to pay, our reputation\nand our business could be adversely affected. </p> <p><b>Our reputation may be harmed if members of our community use unethical business practices. </b></p>\n<p>Our emphasis on our values makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices by Etsy sellers or other members of our\ncommunity. Our policies promote legal and ethical business practices, such as encouraging Etsy sellers to work only with manufacturers who do not use child or involuntary labor, who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane\nworking conditions. However, we do not control Etsy sellers or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies. If members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business\npractices or are perceived to do so, we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed. </p> <p><b>Failure to deal effectively with fraud could\nharm our business. </b></p> <p>Although we have measures in place to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activity in our marketplace, those measures\nmay not always be effective. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>For example, Etsy sellers occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data. Under\ncurrent credit card practices, we may be liable for orders placed through Direct Checkout with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Although we attempt to detect or challenge\nallegedly fraudulent transactions, we may not be able to do so effectively. As a result, our business could be adversely affected. We could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give members the option of paying with credit cards if we\nfail to follow payment card industry data security standards or fail to limit fraudulent transactions conducted in our marketplace. </p> <p>Negative publicity\nand member sentiment resulting from fraudulent or deceptive conduct by members or the perception that our levels of responsiveness and member support are inadequate could reduce our ability to attract new members or retain existing members and\ndamage our reputation. </p> <p><b>If sensitive information about our members is disclosed, or if we or our third-party providers are subject to cyber attacks,\nour members may curtail use of our platform, we may be exposed to liability and our reputation would suffer. </b></p> <p>We collect, transmit and store personal\nand financial information provided by our members, such as names, email addresses, the details of transactions and credit card and other financial information. Some of our third-party service providers, such as identity verification and payment\nprocessing providers, also regularly have access to member data. In an effort to protect sensitive information, we rely on a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. However,\nadvances in computer capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in our failure or inability to adequately protect\nsensitive information. The preventive measures we take to address these risks are costly and may become more costly in the future. </p> <p>Like all online\nservices, our platform is vulnerable to power outages, telecommunications failures and catastrophic events, as well as computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber attacks. Any of these incidents could\nlead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform, loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable or other sensitive information. Cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property. If we gain greater\nvisibility, we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated and more difficult to detect. We\nand our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all such cyber attacks. Moreover, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and may not be known\nuntil launched against us or our third-party service providers. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or employees of our third-party service providers.\n</p> <p>We and our third-party service providers regularly experience cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our third-party service providers’\nservices.

Existing members may also decrease their purchases or stop\nlisting new items for sale or close their accounts altogether. We could also face potential liability and litigation, which may not be adequately covered by insurance. Any of these results could harm our growth prospects, our business and our\nreputation. </p> <p><b>Our business depends on network and mobile infrastructure provided by third parties and on our ability to maintain and scale the\ntechnology underlying our platform. </b></p> <p>The reliability of our platform is important to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain members. As\nour number of members, volume of traffic, number of transactions and the amount of information shared on our platform grow, our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow. The operation of the technology underlying our\nplatform is expensive and complex, and we could experience operational failures. If we fail to accurately predict the rate or timing of the growth of our platform, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to maintain reliability.\n</p> <p>We also depend on the development and maintenance of the Internet and mobile infrastructure. This includes maintenance of reliable Internet and mobile\nnetworks with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as timely development of complementary products. </p> <p>Third-party providers host much\nof our technology infrastructure. Any disruption in their services, or any failure of our providers to handle the demands of our marketplace could significantly harm our business. We exercise little control over these providers, which increases our\nvulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide. If we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or do not expand our technology infrastructure successfully, then our ability to attract and\nretain members could be adversely affected, which could harm our growth prospects and our business. </p> <p><b>Our business depends on continued and unimpeded\naccess to the Internet and mobile networks. </b></p> <p>Our members rely on access to the Internet or mobile networks to access our marketplace. Internet\nservice providers may choose to disrupt or degrade our members’ access to our platform or increase the cost of such access. Mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on our members’\nability to download and use our mobile apps. </p> <p>Internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access\nto our platform. Although the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, recently approved new rules that would prohibit Internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain\n“fast traffic” lanes, these rules will not go into effect until later this year and could be subject to legal challenge or statutory preemption, which could delay or prevent implementation. If the FCC’s rules are not implemented, our\nbusiness could be adversely impacted. Outside of the United States, government regulation of the Internet, including the idea of network neutrality, may be developing or non-existent. As a result, we could face discriminatory or anti-competitive\npractices that could impede both our and Etsy sellers’ growth prospects, increase our costs and harm our business. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><b>Our business is subject to a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. laws, many of which are evolving. </b></p>\n<p>We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and around the world, including those relating to traditional businesses, such as\nemployment laws and taxation, and newer laws and regulations focused on the Internet and online commerce, such as payment systems, privacy, anti-spam, data protection, electronic contracts and consumer protection. These laws and regulations are\ncontinuously evolving, and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort. Additionally, it is not always clear how existing laws apply to the Internet as many of these laws do not\naddress the unique issues raised by the Internet or online commerce. </p> <p>For example, laws relating to online privacy are evolving differently in different\njurisdictions. Federal, state and non-U.S. governmental authorities, as well as courts interpreting the laws, continue to evaluate the privacy implications of the use of third-party “cookies,” “web beacons” and other methods of\nonline tracking. The United States, the European Union and other governments have enacted or are considering legislation that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to collect and store user information, such as by\nregulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools. </p> <p>Some providers of\nconsumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or have announced plans to implement, ways to block tracking technologies which, if widely adopted, could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective. Any reduction\nin our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of Etsy buyers, increase our costs and limit our ability to attract new members and retain existing members on cost-effective terms. As a\nresult, our business could be adversely affected. </p> <p>In some cases, non-U.S. privacy, data protection, consumer protection and other laws and regulations\nare more restrictive than those in the United States. For example, the European Union traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under such laws than the United States. Consequently, the expansion of our operations internationally may require\nchanges to the ways we collect and use consumer information. </p> <p>Existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal, state or non-U.S. governments could impede the growth or use of the Internet or online commerce. It is also possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even\nattempt to block access to our platform. If we are restricted from operating in one or more countries, our ability to attract or retain members may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate. </p>\n<p>We strive to comply with all applicable laws, but they may conflict with each other, and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction, we\nmay find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction. Despite our efforts, we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future. If we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us, we could be\nrequired to pay significant fines and penalties, and we may be forced to change the way we operate. That could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services, which could negatively affect our business.\n</p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nAdditionally, if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies, those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business. </p>\n<p><b>We may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately. </b></p>\n<p>Our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business. To establish and protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trade\nsecret, copyright, trademark and, to a lesser extent, patent laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. We generally do\nnot elect to register our copyrights or the majority of our trademarks, relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property, which may not be sufficient. In addition, our copyrights and trademarks, whether or not registered,\nand patents, may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged. While we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property, we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting\nintellectual property. To the extent we do seek patent protection, any U.S. or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. </p>\n<p>In addition, we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in\nlitigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert our management’s attention. In addition, our efforts may be met with\ndefenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable. If we are unable to cost-effectively protect our\nintellectual property rights, then our business could be harmed. </p> <p><b>We may be subject to claims that items listed in our marketplace are counterfeit,\ninfringing or illegal. </b></p> <p>Although we do not create or take possession of the items listed in our marketplace by Etsy sellers, we frequently receive\ncommunications alleging that items listed in our marketplace infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights. We have intellectual property complaint and take-down procedures in place to address these\ncommunications, and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our marketplace. We follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine whether to take the appropriate action, which may include removal\nof the item from our marketplace and, in certain cases, closing the shops of Etsy sellers who repeatedly violate our policies. </p> <p>Our procedures may not\neffectively reduce or eliminate our liability. In particular, we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by Etsy sellers on our platform, especially outside the United States where we may be less protected under\nlocal laws than we are in the United States. Under current U.S.&nbsp;copyright law and the Communications Decency Act, we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from liability for content posted by our members. However,\ntrademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions, liability for these forms of intellectual property is often </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\ndetermined by court decisions. These safe harbors and court rulings may change unfavorably. In that event, we may be held secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement of Etsy\nsellers. </p> <p>Regardless of the validity of any claims made against us, we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them. If a\ngovernmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by Etsy sellers on our platform, we could face regulatory, civil or\ncriminal penalties. Successful claims by third-party rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items. These types of claims could force us to modify our business\npractices, which could lower our revenue, increase our costs or make our platform less user-friendly for our members. Moreover, public perception that counterfeit or other unauthorized items are common in our marketplace, even if factually\nincorrect, could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation. </p> <p><b>We may be subject to intellectual property claims, which are extremely\ncostly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. </b></p> <p>Companies in\nthe Internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We periodically receive notices that claim we have infringed, misappropriated or\nmisused other parties’ intellectual property rights. To the extent we gain greater public recognition, we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims. Third-party intellectual property rights may cover\nsignificant aspects of our technologies or business methods or block us from expanding our offerings. Any intellectual property claim against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the\nattention of our management. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters. </p>\n<p>In addition, some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent\nholding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights. Any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop\nusing technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights. We also might be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay\nsignificant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. If we cannot license or\ndevelop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm our business. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><b>We may be involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming. </b></p>\n<p>In addition to intellectual property claims, we may become involved in other litigation matters, including class action lawsuits. Any lawsuit to which we are\na party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or\nadverse changes to our offerings or business practices. Any of these results could adversely affect our business. In addition, defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management. </p>\n<p><b>Our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors. </b></p>\n<p>The software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the\ncode has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment,” meaning that we typically release software code many times per day. This practice may result in the more frequent introduction of\nerrors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of members, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which\ncould adversely affect our growth prospects and our business. </p> <p><b>We are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates\nopen source software. </b></p> <p>The software powering our marketplace incorporates software covered by open source licenses. In addition, we regularly\ncontribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses, and we anticipate doing so in the future. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts and\nthere is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplace. Under certain open source licenses, we could be required to publicly release the source\ncode of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses. To avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of\nour software. In addition, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Use of open\nsource software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software source\ncode we contribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from\nusing such contributed software source code. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><b>Our business and our members may be subject to sales and other taxes. </b></p>\n<p>The application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, or VAT, provincial taxes, goods and services tax, business tax and gross\nreceipt tax, to businesses like ours and to our members is a complex and evolving issue. For example, as of January 1, 2015, the European Union imposed an obligation on marketplaces to collect and remit VAT on sales of automatically-downloaded\ndigital items, and we are in the process of implementing such collection and remittance procedures. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and could change. In many\ncases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our business or to Etsy sellers’ businesses. One or more states, the federal government or other countries may seek to impose additional\nreporting, record-keeping or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce. For example, the U.S. Congress is currently considering the “Marketplace Fairness Act,” which would grant states the\nauthority to require online merchants to collect sales tax on online sales at the time a transaction is completed. New taxes could also require us or Etsy sellers to incur substantial costs to capture data and collect and remit taxes. If such\nobligations were imposed, the additional costs associated with tax collection, remittance and audit requirements could make selling in our marketplace less attractive and more costly for Etsy sellers, which could adversely affect our business. </p>\n<p><b>We may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate. </b></p>\n<p>We are subject to taxation in the United States and in numerous other jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of\nfuture tax payments, which may include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits. At any one time, multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there\ncould be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, changes in the\nmix of revenue among different jurisdictions, changes to accounting rules and changes to our ownership or capital structure. Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business. </p>\n<p>In January 2015, we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans\noutside of the United States. Our new corporate structure changes how we use our intellectual property and implements certain intercompany arrangements, which we expect may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate and other\noperational efficiencies. The tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to interpretation, and their application may depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure. Moreover,\nthese tax laws are subject to change. Tax authorities may disagree with our position as to the tax treatment of our transfer of intangible assets or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax\nconsequences. If our new corporate structure does not achieve our expectations for any of these or other reasons, we may be subject to a higher overall effective tax rate and our business may be adversely affected. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><b>We rely on consumer discretionary spending and may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other\nmacroeconomic conditions or trends. </b></p> <p>Macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business. If general economic conditions deteriorate in the\nUnited States or other markets where we operate, consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods available in our marketplace may be reduced. This would cause sales in our marketplace to decline and adversely impact our\nbusiness. Conversely, if recent trends supporting self-employment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse, the number of Etsy sellers offering their goods in our marketplace could decline and the number of goods listed in our\nmarketplace could decline. </p> <p>Even without changes in economic conditions, the demand for the goods listed in our marketplace is dependent on consumer\npreferences. Consumer preferences can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures. If demand for the goods that Etsy sellers offer in our marketplace declines, our business would be harmed. Trends in socially-conscious consumerism\nand buying locally could also shift or slow to the detriment of our business. Our growth prospects would also be hampered if the shift to online and mobile commerce does not continue. </p>\n<p><b>The terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. </b></p>\n<p>We do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility.

If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities. The sale of additional equity securities\ncould result in dilution to our existing stockholders.

For example, we intend to take advantage of the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on\nexecutive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments.

For example, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, or the\nExchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The rules and regulations of\nNasdaq will also apply to us following this offering. As part of the new requirements, we will need to establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and make changes to our corporate governance practices. We expect that\ncompliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming. </p> <p>Most of our\nmanagement and other personnel have little experience managing a public company and preparing public filings. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from other business matters to devote\nsubstantial time to the reporting and other requirements of being a public company. In particular, we expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort to complying with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act. We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. </p>\n<p><b>Our management will not be required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the end of the fiscal year for\nwhich our second annual report is due.

In addition, we could become subject to\ninvestigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business. </p>\n<p>As described below we currently have two material weaknesses, which we are in the process of remediating. </p>\n<p><b>We currently have identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in material\nmisstatements of our financial statements. </b></p> <p>In connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31,\n2014, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </p> <p>First, we\ndetermined that we did not have adequate procedures and controls to appropriately account for certain non-income tax-related expenses and comply with the related filing requirements. Second, we determined that we did not have adequate cut-off\nprocedures to ensure the timely recording of certain period-end accruals. </p> <p>These two material weaknesses resulted in a misstatement of expenses in prior\nperiods that were immaterial to previously issued annual financial statements but in combination were material to certain interim periods. The impact of these material weaknesses resulted in the revision of our consolidated financial statements for\nthe years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013, the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2013, the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, the three months ended December 31, 2013 and\nthe three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014. The impacts of these material weaknesses also resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, the three and six months ended\nJune&nbsp;30, 2014 and the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014. </p> <p>Neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm has performed an\nevaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

As a result, investors purchasing common stock in this offering will incur immediate dilution of $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; per share, based on the\ninitial public offering price of $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; per share, the midpoint of the price range on the cover page of this prospectus. </p>\n<p>This dilution is due to the substantially lower price paid by our investors who purchased shares prior to this offering as compared to the price offered to\nthe public in this offering. In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, there were outstanding options to purchase 23,050,594 shares of our common stock with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $2.67&nbsp;per share and warrants to\npurchase 406,060 shares of our common stock (including preferred stock on an as-converted basis) with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $0.66&nbsp;per share. The exercise of any of these options or warrants would result in\nadditional dilution. As a result of the dilution to investors purchasing shares in this offering, investors may receive less than the purchase price paid in this offering in the event of our liquidation. See “Dilution.” </p>\n<p><b>Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders following this offering could cause the price\nof our common stock to decline. </b></p> <p>Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales\nmight occur, could depress the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing price of our common stock.\n</p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>All of our executive officers and directors and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock are\nsubject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of this offering that restrict the stockholders’ ability to transfer shares of our common stock for periods of at least 180 days, and for a portion of the shares, 270 and 360 days from the\ndate of this prospectus. The lock-up agreements limit the number of shares of common stock that may be sold immediately following this offering. Subject to certain limitations, approximately\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 180-day lock-up period, approximately\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 270-day lock-up period and approximately\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 360-day lock-up period. In addition, based on our capitalization as of December&nbsp;31,\n2014, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants will also be eligible for sale upon expiration of the 180-day lock-up period. We intend to register\nall of the shares underlying outstanding options and any shares underlying other equity incentives we may grant in the future for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be\nable to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and the lock-up agreements described above. Sales of stock by these stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our\ncommon stock. </p> <p>Certain holders of shares of our common stock have registration rights. See “Description of Capital Stock—Registration\nRights.” Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the\nSecurities Act. Sales of securities by any of these stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. </p> <p><b>Future sales and\nissuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. </b></p>\n<p>We may issue additional common stock, convertible securities or other equity following the completion of this offering. We also expect to issue common stock\nto our employees, directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. New investors in such issuances could also\nreceive rights senior to those of holders of our common stock. </p> <p><b>If analysts do not publish research about our business or if they publish inaccurate or\nunfavorable research, our stock price and trading volume could decline. </b></p> <p>The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research\nand reports that analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our common stock would likely decline. If few analysts cover us, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in\nthe future or fail to publish reports on us regularly. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><b>Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our\ncompany more difficult, could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock. </b></p> <p>Provisions in our\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including continued investments in the growth of our business. Consistent with our values and our mission, we\nalso intend to use $300,000 of the proceeds of this offering to partially fund Etsy.org, a Delaware non-profit organization that we formed in January 2015. Etsy.org will be dedicated to educating women and other under-represented entrepreneurial\npopulations and empowering them to build businesses that regenerate communities and the planet. See “Business—Our Strategy: The Path Ahead” for additional information about Etsy.org. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund\nthe build-out of our new corporate headquarters. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering for acquisitions of other complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. However, we have no current\nunderstandings, agreements or commitments for any specific material acquisitions at this time.

We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the\noperation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future decision to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend\non a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors thinks are relevant. Under Delaware law, we\ncan only pay dividends either out of “surplus” or out of the current or the immediately preceding year’s net profits. Surplus is defined as the excess, if any, at any given time, of the total assets of a corporation over its total\nliabilities and statutory capital. As a result, we may not pay dividends according to our policy or at all if, among other things, we do not have sufficient cash to pay the intended dividends. Our future ability to pay cash dividends on our stock\nmay be limited by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities and is limited by the terms of our Credit Agreement.

Handmade goods are the\nfoundation of our marketplace. Whether crafted by an Etsy seller herself, with the assistance of her team or with an outside manufacturer in small batches, handmade goods spring from the imagination and creativity of an Etsy seller and embody\nauthorship, responsibility and transparency. We believe we are creating a new economy, which we call the Etsy Economy, where creative entrepreneurs find meaningful work and both global and local markets for their goods, and where thoughtful\nconsumers discover and buy unique goods and build relationships with the people who sell them. </p> <p>Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York as a\nmarketplace for handmade goods and craft supplies. From those beginnings, we have built an innovative, technology-based platform that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, connected 54.0 million members, including 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8\nmillion active buyers, in nearly every country in the world. In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93&nbsp;billion, of which 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% came from an Etsy seller or an Etsy buyer outside of the\nUnited States. </p> <p>Our business has grown in significant ways: </p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Our GMS was $1.35 billion in 2013, up 50.6% over 2012, and was $1.93&nbsp;billion in 2014, up 43.3% over 2013. </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Our revenue was $125.0 million in 2013, up 67.6% over 2012.

dollar value of items sold in our marketplace within the applicable period, excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with cancelled transactions. GMS does not represent revenue earned by us. GMS relates only to\nMarketplace activity and does not reflect Seller Services activity. However, because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace, we believe that GMS is an indicator of the success of\nEtsy sellers, the satisfaction of Etsy buyers, the health of our ecosystem and the scale and growth of our business. </p> <p><b>Adjusted EBITDA </b></p>\n<p>Adjusted EBITDA represents our net (loss) income before interest expense, net, (benefit) provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization,\nadjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense, net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities, foreign exchange loss and acquisition-related expenses. In future periods, we intend to exclude the impact of our contributions to Etsy.org\nfrom Adjusted EBITDA. We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare\nand approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans and assess the health of our ecosystem. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more resources in our community.

Because of this, we provide services to an Etsy seller to help her\nstart and grow her shop. As of December 31, 2014, 18.2% of active sellers used Promoted Listings, 36.1% of active sellers used Direct Checkout and 21.4% of active sellers in the United States and Canada used Shipping Labels. Our effectiveness in\nincreasing the uptake of our Seller Services, enhancing existing Seller Services and extending their geographic reach and introducing new Seller Services will directly impact the success of Etsy sellers, our revenue growth and our operating results.\n</p> <p><b>International Growth </b></p> <p>Our growth will depend in\npart on international Etsy sellers and international Etsy buyers constituting an increasing portion of our community. International GMS was 28.4% of GMS in 2013 compared to 30.9% in 2014. Currently, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are based in nearly\nevery country in the world, and our marketplace is available in 10 languages. Although we promote cross-border transactions, our strategy is to build and deepen local Etsy communities around the world, each with its own ecosystem of Etsy sellers and\nEtsy buyers. To meet this goal, we plan to invest in local marketing and content and local payment and shipping solutions. An inability to develop these Etsy communities or to otherwise grow our business outside the United States on a cost-effective\nbasis could adversely affect our GMS, revenue and other operating results. </p> <p><b>Mobile Growth </b></p>\n<p>We believe continued enhancement of the mobile features of our platform will be critical to attracting and retaining Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers and\nmaintaining the vibrancy of our marketplace. The success of this effort will be increasingly important as shopping on mobile devices displaces shopping on desktops and as Etsy sellers increasingly seek to run their shops via mobile devices. </p>\n<p>We launched our first mobile app in 2011 and since then have expanded our mobile offerings for both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. Our “Sell on\nEtsy” mobile app, which we launched in April 2014, is designed to help an Etsy seller operate her shop, manage orders and access resources. Our Etsy buyer apps and mobile web experience include features designed to keep Etsy buyers engaged and\noffer an improved shopping experience. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, our mobile apps have been downloaded 21.8 million times, and mobile visits represented 53.2% of visits in 2014. In addition, in the same period, mobile GMS was 36.1% of GMS. If we\nare unable to continue to engage Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers through our mobile offerings, then our GMS and revenue growth and other operating results could be adversely affected. </p>\n<p><b>Investment in Marketing </b></p> <p>To date, we have grown largely\ndue to strong brand awareness and word-of-mouth referrals, with the majority of our visits coming from direct and organic channels.

In 2014, we spent $39.7 million on marketing expenses, or 20.3% of revenue, up 122.2% over 2013. Our growth will depend in part on our\ncontinued ability to launch marketing campaigns that resonate with new and existing members and appropriately balance our level of marketing spending with the benefits that may be realized through member and revenue growth. </p>\n<p><b>Investment in Growth </b></p> <p>We have made, and will continue\nto make, significant investments in our platform to attract members and enhance the member experience. In 2013, we spent $27.5 million on product development expenses, or 22.0% of revenue, up 47.7% over 2012, and in 2014, we spent $36.6 million on\nproduct development expenses, or 18.7% of revenue, up 33.0% over 2013. We have invested significant resources in our technology platform and infrastructure to date and plan to continue to invest in innovation to address the needs of our members. We\nalso plan to hire additional personnel to address the needs of our community. As part of this growth in headcount, we signed a lease in May&nbsp;2014 for a new headquarters facility to accommodate our anticipated growth in personnel. The investments\nwe make in our platform are all designed to grow our ecosystem and revenue and to improve our operating results in the long term, but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce our profitability in the near\nterm. </p> <p>Components of Our Results of Operations </p> <p><b>Revenue\n</b></p> <p>Our revenue consists of Marketplace revenue, Seller Services revenue and Other revenue. </p>\n<p><i>Marketplace revenue.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketplace revenue consists of the 3.5% fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on our platform,\nexclusive of shipping fees charged.

consisted of Seller Services revenue. </p> <p>Marketplace revenue increased $30.2 million, or 38.4%, to $108.7 million in 2014\ncompared to 2013. This growth corresponded with a 43.3% increase in GMS to a total of $1.93&nbsp;billion for 2014. As our GMS increased, our Marketplace revenue increased, primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of transaction fees\nreceived and an increase in listings from new and existing Etsy sellers with a corresponding increase in listing fees received. During 2014, international GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to 30.9%, up from 28.4% for 2013. During 2014,\nmobile GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to 36.1%, up from 29.5% for 2013. Active sellers increased 26.0% to 1.4&nbsp;million and active buyers increased 41.2% to 19.8&nbsp;million for 2014 compared to 2013. </p>\n<p>Seller Services revenue increased $39.7 million, or 92.7%, to $82.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The growth in Seller Services revenue was primarily\ndriven by an increase in revenue from Direct Checkout services, as well as increases in Promoted Listings and Shipping Labels. The increase in Direct Checkout services revenue reflects continued increases in U.S. Direct Checkout revenue, as well as\ngrowth in international Direct Checkout services as those services were initiated in the second quarter of 2013. As of December 31, 2014, we offered Direct Checkout in 10 currencies, including the U.S. dollar. The increase in Promoted Listings\nrevenue reflects enhancements made to the service in 2014. The increase in Shipping Label revenue reflects an increase in the number of Etsy sellers using the service and, to a lesser extent, the introduction of Shipping Labels in Canada in 2014.\n</p> <p>Other revenue increased $0.7 million, or 19.0%, to $4.4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Other revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue,\nhowever, as Etsy buyers opted to use Direct Checkout for&nbsp;their purchases rather than a third-party payment processor. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><b>Cost of Revenue </b></p> \n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\n\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"62%\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"3%\"></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"3%\"></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"5%\"></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"5%\"></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"6\"><b>Year&nbsp;Ended<br>December&nbsp;31,</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"6\"><b>Change</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"2\"><b>2013</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"2\"><b>2014</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"2\" nowrap=\"\"><b>$</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"2\"><b>%</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"14\"><b>(in thousands, except percentages)</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td></tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Cost of revenue</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;47,779</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;73,633</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;25,854</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">54.1</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">%&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Percentage of total revenue</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">38.2</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">%&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">37.6</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">%&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td></tr>\n</tbody></table> <p>Cost of revenue increased $25.9 million, or 54.1%, to $73.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an\nincrease in the cost of supporting Direct Checkout revenue due to the introduction of international Direct Checkout as well as growth in the U.S. Direct Checkout revenue.

fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with\na wide range of tax rates, the amount of stock-based compensation expense and net unrealized loss

as tax rate changes. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we determined that the existence of a three-year cumulative loss in a foreign jurisdiction was sufficient negative evidence to warrant\nthe establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets of $0 as of December 31, 2013 and $2.1 million as of December 31,\n2014. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a

consisted of Seller Services revenue. </p> <p>Marketplace revenue increased $23.2 million, or 42.0%, to $78.5 million in 2013\ncompared to 2012. This growth corresponded with a 50.6% increase in GMS to a total of $1.35 billion for 2013. As our GMS increased, our Marketplace revenue increased, primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of transaction fees received\nand an increase in listings from new and existing Etsy sellers with a corresponding increase in listing fees received. During 2013, international GMS as a percentage of total GMS was 28.4%, and mobile GMS as a percentage of total GMS was 29.5%.\nActive sellers increased 29.4% to 1.1&nbsp;million and active buyers increased 50.6% to 14.0&nbsp;million for 2013 compared to 2012. </p> <p>Seller Services\nrevenue increased $27.0 million, or 169.9%, to $42.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The growth in Seller Services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from Direct Checkout services, as well as increases in Promoted Listings and\nShipping Labels. The increase in Direct Checkout services revenue reflects a full year of U.S. Direct Checkout revenue, as the service was first introduced in the United States in the second quarter of 2012, as well as the introduction of\ninternational Direct Checkout services starting in the second half of 2013. As of the end of 2013, we offered Direct Checkout in 10 currencies, including the U.S. dollar. The increase in Promoted Listings revenue and the increase in Shipping Label\nrevenue reflect an increase in the number of Etsy sellers using these services. </p> <p>Other revenue increased $0.3 million, or 7.4%, to $3.7 million in 2013\ncompared to 2012. Other revenue decreased as a percentage of revenue, however, as Etsy buyers opted to use Direct Checkout for their purchases rather than a third-party payment processor. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><b>Cost of Revenue </b></p> \n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\n\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"62%\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"5%\"></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"5%\"></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"5%\"></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"5%\"></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"6\"><b>Year Ended<br>December&nbsp;31,</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"6\"><b>Change</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"2\"><b>2012</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"2\"><b>2013</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"2\" nowrap=\"\"><b>$</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"2\"><b>%</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" colspan=\"14\"><b>(in thousands, except percentages)</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td></tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Cost of revenue</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;24,493</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;47,779</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;23,286</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">95.1</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">%&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Percentage of total revenue</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">32.8</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">%&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">38.2</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">%&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td></tr>\n</tbody></table> <p>Cost of revenue increased $23.3 million, or 95.1%, to $47.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of an\nincrease in the cost of supporting Direct Checkout revenue due to the introduction of international Direct Checkout as well as growth in the U.S. Direct Checkout revenue. To a lesser extent, the increase was due to an increase in depreciation and\namortization for ongoing maintenance of our technology infrastructure and an increase in employee-related costs resulting

<p>Seasonality and Quarterly Trends </p>\n<p>Etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more Seller Services during the fourth-quarter holiday shopping season. This has resulted in increased\nrevenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, which can compare to lower revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. For example, revenue in the first quarter of 2014 decreased slightly when compared with revenue in\nthe fourth quarter of 2013. We expect this seasonality to continue in future years. Our operating (loss) income has also been affected by these historical trends because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. As our growth\nrates begin to moderate, the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced. </p> <p>Our quarterly revenue increased\nsequentially quarter-to-quarter for all periods presented above, other than the first quarter of 2014, corresponding to our GMS performance in the same periods. We cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue growth will continue. We\nbelieve that it is generally more meaningful to compare year-over-year results than sequential quarter-over-quarter results. </p> <p>Our quarterly cost of\nrevenue increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for substantially all periods presented above, primarily due to increases in visits and to increased usage of Direct Checkout during the period and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in\nemployee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our member support and technical operations teams. </p> <p>Marketing expenses increased\nsequentially quarter-to-quarter for substantially all periods presented above, and significantly increased beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to increased marketing </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nprograms to attract and retain new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers on our platform and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our\nmarketing team, which includes our public relations and communications teams. </p> <p>Product development expenses generally remained consistent or increased\nsequentially quarter-to-quarter for the periods presented above, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our product and engineering teams. </p>\n<p>General and administrative expenses increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for substantially all periods presented above, primarily as a result of an\nincrease in employee-related costs from headcount growth in general corporate functions and from building out the executive management team. </p> <p>Our\nbusiness is directly affected by the behavior of consumers.

We intend to increase our capital expenditures to support the growth in our business and operations, and intend to invest approximately $50.0 million through the middle of 2016 to build out our new\nBrooklyn, New York headquarters. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet\nour anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. We may seek to borrow funds under our\nCredit Agreement or raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in the\nsection of this prospectus captioned “Risk Factors.” We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><b>Sources of Liquidity </b></p>\n<p>Since our inception, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows generated by operations and through non-registered\nsales of preferred stock and common stock. Since inception and as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we have raised a total of $125.6 million from the sale of preferred stock and common stock (including proceeds from the exercise of stock options), net of\ncosts and expenses associated with such financings and net of repurchases of $0.5&nbsp;million of capital stock. </p> <p><b>Credit Facility </b></p>\n<p>In May 2014, we entered into a $35.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a Revolving Credit and Guaranty Agreement with several\nlenders, or the Credit Agreement. In March 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the credit facility to $50.0 million. As amended, the Credit Agreement will mature in May 2019. The amended Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit\nsublimit of $10.0 million and a swingline loan sublimit of $15.0 million. </p> <p>Borrowings under the amended Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans)\nbear interest, at our option, at (i)&nbsp;a base rate equal to the highest of (a)&nbsp;the prime rate, (b)&nbsp;the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c)&nbsp;an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case plus a\nmargin ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or (ii)&nbsp;an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.25%. Swingline loans under the amended Credit Agreement bear interest at the same base rate (plus the margin applicable to borrowings\nbearing interest at the base rate). These margins are determined based on the total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an\nunused commitment fee and fees associated with letters of credit. As amended, the Credit Agreement also permits us, in certain circumstances, to request an increase in the facility by an additional amount of up to $50.0&nbsp;million (and in minimum\namounts of $10.0&nbsp;million) at the same maturity, pricing and other terms. </p> <p>The amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and\nwarranties applicable to us and our subsidiaries and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our restricted subsidiaries. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness, liens, investments,\nmergers, dispositions, transactions with affiliates and dividends and other distributions. These restrictions do not prohibit any of our subsidiaries from making pro rata payments to us or any other person that owns an equity interest in any such\nsubsidiary. The amended Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a total leverage ratio (defined as net debt to adjusted EBITDA) not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. </p>\n<p>As amended, the Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including a change in control and a cross-default on our material indebtedness.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the\nyears in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the need\nfor a valuation allowance on an annual basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to be realized. </p> <p>We account for uncertainty in income\ntaxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely\nthan not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. We have no unrecognized\ntax benefits at December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013 and have an unrecognized tax benefit of $0.4 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. </p> <p>We recognize interest\nand penalties, if any, associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet. </p>\n<p><b>Website Development and Internal-Use Software </b></p> <p>We\ncapitalize certain costs incurred in connection with software developed for our platform and software developed for internal use. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when\npreliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding and it is probable that the project will be completed and the </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nsoftware will be used as intended. We also capitalize costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the\nuseful life of existing functionality. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically three years. </p> <p>We periodically\nreview these assets to determine whether the projects will be completed, placed in service, removed from service or replaced by other internally-developed or third-party software; if an asset is not expected to provide any future benefit, the asset\nis retired and any unamortized cost is expensed. </p> <p>Costs related to the design or maintenance of software developed for our platform and software\ndeveloped for internal use are expensed as incurred. </p> <p><b>Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets </b></p>\n<p>We have completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. The results\nof businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price, which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash, equity or a\ncombination of the two, in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and\nliabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of\nfuture revenues and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. </p> <p>When we issue stock-based or cash awards to an acquired\ncompany’s stockholders, we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued\nemployment of the acquired company’s stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite\nservice period. </p> <p>We carry intangible assets at cost, and we amortize them on a straight-line basis, which approximates the pattern of the benefits\nderived, over their estimated useful lives, typically three to five years. When circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, we review our identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment. </p>\n<p>Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, as well as when events indicate that the carrying amount of this asset\nmay exceed its fair value. The assessment is performed at the reporting unit level using the two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the book\nvalue including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value, goodwill is not impaired. If the book value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of the impairment. The\naccounting guidance also allows for a simplified approach to testing for impairment, in </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nwhich a company can assess certain qualitative factors (referred to as “step zero”) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less\nthan its carrying amount. If that is the case, the entity must perform the quantitative analysis. </p> <p>No impairment of goodwill was recorded at December 31,\n2013 or 2014. </p> <p><b>Leases </b></p> <p>We lease office space and\ncertain computer equipment in multiple locations under non-cancelable lease agreements. The leases are reviewed for classification as operating or capital leases. For operating leases, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nperiod. For capital leases, we record the leased asset with a corresponding liability. Payments are recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on their outstanding remaining liability. </p>\n<p>We consider the nature of the renovations and our involvement during the construction period of newly-leased office\nspace to determine if we are considered to be the owner of the construction project during the construction period. If we determine that we are the owner of the construction project, we are required to capitalize the fair value of the building as\nwell as the construction costs incurred on our consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability (“build-to-suit accounting”). Upon occupancy for build-to-suit leases, we assess whether the circumstances qualify for\nsales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the lease meets the sale-leaseback criteria, we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease. If\nupon completion of construction, the project does not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria, the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes. </p>\n<p><b>Stock-Based Compensation </b></p> <p>Stock options awarded to\nemployees, members of our board of directors and non-employee third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date. We consider what we believe to be comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted free cash flows and an analysis of our\nenterprise value in estimating the fair value of our common stock. Options generally vest over a four-year period with 25% of the shares underlying the options vesting on the date that is 12 months after the vesting commencement date and thereafter\n1/48th of the shares vesting each month, subject to continued service with us through each vesting date. </p> <p>Stock-based compensation cost is measured on\nthe grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award using a Black-Scholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We expect to continue to\ngrant stock options in the future, and, to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase. </p>\n<p>We account for stock-based compensation arrangements with non-employees using a fair value approach. The fair value of these options is measured using the\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model reflecting the </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nsame assumptions as applied to employee options in each of the reported periods, other than the expected life, which is assumed to be the contractual life of the option. The compensation costs of\nthese arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned. </p> <p>We account for stock-based compensation arrangements in restricted\nshares, subject to a put option that allows the holder of the shares to put the shares back to us for cash, as liability-classified stock awards. These awards are re-measured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value being charged to the\nstatement of operations. Compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting methodology for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. Unless the put option is exercised, the\nrestricted shares will be reclassified from a liability to an equity classified award upon the termination of the put option. </p> <p><i>Key Assumptions </i></p>\n<p>Our Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the\nexpected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of the option and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. </p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><i>Fair Value of Our Common Stock</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because our stock is not publicly traded, we must estimate the fair value of our common stock, as discussed in “—Common Stock Valuations” below.\n</td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><i>Expected Volatility</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have not been a public company and do not have a trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the\naverage historical price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants.

offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, the intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nwas $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; million, of which $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; million and $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; million related to stock options that were vested and unvested,\nrespectively, at that date. </p> <p>In valuing our common stock, our board of directors determined the equity value of our business using the income approach.\nThe income approach estimates the fair value of a company based on the present value of such company’s future estimated cash flows and the residual value of such company beyond the forecast period. These future values are discounted to their\npresent values to reflect the risks inherent in such company achieving these estimated cash flows. Significant inputs of the income approach (in addition to </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nour estimated future cash flows themselves) include the long-term growth rate assumed in the residual value, discount rate and normalized long-term operating margin. The terminal value was\ncalculated to estimate our value beyond the forecast period by applying valuation metrics to the final year of our forecasted revenue and discounting that value to the present value using the same weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, applied\nto the forecasted periods. </p> <p>For valuations through February&nbsp;10, 2014, the equity value determined was allocated to the common stock using the Option\nPricing Method, or OPM. The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on an equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock. Therefore, the common stock has value only if the funds\navailable for distribution to the stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preference at the time of a liquidity event such as a merger, sale or initial public offering, assuming the enterprise has funds available to make a liquidation\npreference meaningful and collectible by the stockholders. The common stock is modeled to be a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the preferred stock is liquidated. The OPM\nuses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to price the call options. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is so difficult to predict that forecasts would be highly speculative. </p>\n<p>Beginning with the March&nbsp;31, 2014 valuation, we changed the methodology for allocating our equity value to our common stock to a probability weighted\nexpected return method, or PWERM. We made this change as greater certainty developed regarding a possible liquidity event. The PWERM methodology relies on a forward-looking analysis to predict the possible future value of a company. Under this\nmethod, discrete future outcomes, including initial public offering, non-IPO scenarios and a merger or sale are weighted based on our estimate of the probability of each scenario. We applied a hybrid method of the PWERM where the non-IPO scenario is\nmodeled using an OPM to reflect the full distribution of possible non-IPO outcomes. The hybrid method is useful when certain discrete future outcomes can be predicted, but also accounts for uncertainty regarding the timing or likelihood of specific\nalternative exit events. </p> <p>Recent Accounting Pronouncements </p>\n<p>Under the JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an emerging growth company. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for\ncomplying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section&nbsp;107(b) of the JOBS Act. </p> <p>In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard, or FASB, issued new accounting guidance clarifying the accounting for the release of cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a company either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a\ncontrolling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or\nafter December&nbsp;15, 2013. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that will replace existing revenue recognition\nguidance. Among other things, the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be\nentitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning January&nbsp;1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. </p>\n<p>In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update under which management will be required to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern and provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after&nbsp;December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is\nnot expected to have an impact on our financial statements or disclosures. </p> <p>Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk </p>\n<p>We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including\nthe effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below. </p>\n<p><b>Interest Rate Sensitivity </b></p> <p>Cash and cash equivalents\nand short-term investments as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 were held primarily in cash deposits and money market funds. The fair value of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments would not be significantly affected by either an increase or\ndecrease in interest rates due mainly to the short-term nature of these instruments. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility. Any future borrowings incurred under the credit facility would accrue interest\nat a floating rate based on a formula tied to certain market rates at the time of incurrence (as described above). A 10% increase or decrease in our current interest rate would not have a significant impact on our interest expense. </p>\n<p><b>Foreign Currency Risk </b></p> <p>Most of our sales are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, and may be subject\nto fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Pound&nbsp;Sterling and Euro. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of\noperations. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates could result in additional income or expense of $1.8&nbsp;million. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><a target=\"_blank\"></a>Letter from Chad </p>\n<p>The Etsy Economy </p> <p>Since inception, Etsy has challenged\nconventional ways of thinking about commerce, business, individuals and communities. I intend to keep our unconventional operating philosophy as we become a public company, and I welcome new investors into our community. </p>\n<p>When I joined Etsy almost seven years ago, Etsy was an online marketplace for handmade goods, vintage items and craft supplies that connected sellers and\nbuyers. Even in my early days at Etsy, it was clear to me that the vision for Etsy could extend far beyond the founding idea of the company and have even more potential to impact the world for good. </p>\n<p>Vision is just the starting point. I believe Etsy can truly change the world when our vision is met with strong culture, a powerful team and disciplined\nexecution. In my time at Etsy, I’ve put my heart and soul into nurturing a culture and building a team and company that match the ambition of our mission. Today our mission is much more expansive than when Etsy began: to reimagine commerce in\nways that build a more fulfilling and lasting world. </p> <p>The reimagination of commerce means transforming every aspect of how goods are made, bought and\nsold. We believe that Etsy has the long-term potential to transform the world economy into one that is more people-centered and community-focused—one that values and honors designers and makers and one that creates stronger connections among\npeople who make, sell and buy goods. We see an economy that is more sustainable and transparent—and one that is more joyful. We believe in an economy that transcends price and convenience, one that emphasizes relationships over transactions and\noptimizes for authorship and provenance. We call this the Etsy Economy. </p> <p>Building the Etsy Economy matters more than ever. For decades now, the\nconventional and dominant retail model has relentlessly focused on delivering goods at the lowest price, valuing products and profits over community, short-changing the future with the instant gratification of today. I do not believe that this race\nto the bottom is a sustainable, successful model. Our growing community has made it clear that they desire thoughtful alternatives to mass commerce and impersonal retail and products that better reflect their personal style and values. Person by\nperson, sale by sale, we are building a new model to replace the old. With GMS of $1.93 billion in 2014, I see the Etsy Economy emerging. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Etsy’s Values </p>\n<p>If you want to understand Etsy, you’ll have to understand our values. </p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">We are a mindful, transparent and humane business. </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">We plan and build for the long term. </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">We value craftsmanship in all we make. </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">We believe fun should be part of everything we do. </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">We keep it real, always. </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Fundamentally, we believe that companies can and should use the power of business\nto create social good, which is reflected in our status as a Certified B Corporation. Our commitment to using business as a force of good manifests itself in the way we run our business. </p>\n<p>People often ask me how I choose between the success of our community and the success of our business. My answer is that I don’t have to choose; we have\nbuilt a business that does well when our community is successful. Making money matters to Etsy because our financial success creates long-term sustainability for our community. The more we invest in our platform, the more we enable Etsy sellers to\npursue their craft and grow their businesses and the easier we make it for Etsy buyers to find unique goods. We call this Etsy’s Empowerment Loop. </p>\n<p>Community </p> <p>At Etsy, we believe that our strength and business\nsuccess rest in the interdependence among Etsy sellers, Etsy buyers, responsible manufacturers and our employees—in other words, our community. </p>\n<p>Etsy sellers represent a diverse mosaic of needs and aspirations. Some sellers are first-time small business owners and benefit greatly from our seller\nsupport and education programs. The vast majority of sellers on Etsy are one-person shops, and we continue to embrace and develop new ways to support them. Other sellers have grown and need help scaling with the assistance of responsible\nmanufacturers, creating opportunity for other participants in the Etsy Economy. In all cases, we empower each Etsy seller to succeed on her own terms. </p> <p>I\nhave heard concerns that by allowing our sellers to partner with responsible manufacturers, we are diluting our handmade ethos. I share our community’s desire to preserve what is special about Etsy. After all, Etsy has always served as an\nantidote to mass manufacturing. We still do. With our vision of responsible manufacturing, we are promoting a new, people-centered model in which artisans can preserve the spirit of craftsmanship and grow responsibly by collaborating with people at\nsmall-batch manufacturers to make their goods. This brings more hands together to build both products and </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\nmore diverse local, living economies. These local, living economies band together into a larger Etsy Economy made up of individuals with diverse roles but all sharing a collective vision of an\neconomy based on community. </p> <p>When individuals share a collective vision, the power and possibility of community manifest in profound ways. Etsy is, by\ndesign, a collection of many small things. As we grow, Etsy becomes a larger collection of individuals and communities, with compounding benefits when they connect with each other. Etsy sellers have self-organized into more than 10,000 groups around\nthe world, known as “Etsy Teams.” They provide local support to each other and collaborate with Etsy on initiatives, such as teaching entrepreneurship to economically disadvantaged people in their communities, lobbying the government on\nissues important to Etsy sellers, running local craft fairs and translating Etsy’s site into other languages. </p> <p>In 2012, Mayor Larry Morrissey\nreached out to me on Twitter asking how to build an Etsy Economy in his community of Rockford, Illinois. Rockford is a city that has faced challenges familiar to many cities in America and around the world: loss of manufacturing jobs, high\nunemployment and a struggling economy. We worked with Mayor Morrissey, members of the local Rockford Etsy Team, the public education system, local arts organizations and the public housing authority to launch the Etsy Craft Entrepreneurship Program.\nThis program teaches people with a craft skill that entrepreneurship and economic opportunity are within reach on our platform. We have extended this program to 10 cities around the world and see it as an inspirational model for even deeper\ncommunity involvement in the coming years. </p> <p>Our concept of community includes the cities where we live and work, and we run Etsy in a way that supports\nour own local economy and ecosystem. At our headquarters in Brooklyn, twice a week we serve a meal that we call “Eatsy.” Our approach is to foster community and productivity through a meal, designed for employees to eat together on\npicnic-style benches. This meal allows employees to engage with each other, within and across teams, and increases team-building and work relationships throughout the company. Eatsy also serves as an end point for company-wide meetings, so that\nemployees can continue the conversation on important workplace topics. </p> <p>In 2014, we sourced food from over 40 local businesses with an emphasis on our\nhealth and ecological impact. We eat on compostable plates, and employees sign up to deliver our compost by bike to a local farm in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where it is turned back into the soil that produces the food we enjoy together. In this way,\nEatsy goes into the very soil we live and work on. Eatsy is a metaphor for how I think about many aspects of our business and our relationship to the world around us: regenerative, mindful, interdependent, community-based and fun. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Why Etsy Should be a Public Company </p>\n<p>I believe the principles and resources of being a public company align well with the model of shared success that is fundamental to Etsy’s way of doing\nbusiness, namely that we make money when our sellers make money. Investing in the growth of our business and increasing Etsy’s visibility will help elevate Etsy sellers and attract more buyers, which creates more opportunities for everyone.\n</p> <p><b>Accountability / transparency </b></p> <p>Etsy has a long\nhistory of providing data to the community, everything from key financial metrics, to our gross happiness index, to our carbon footprint data, to our workplace diversity stats. As a public company, we will be able to provide a higher level of\ntransparency and accountability to a broader number of people. </p> <p><b>Community participation </b></p>\n<p>Being a private company means that most people don’t have an opportunity to invest in Etsy. When Etsy is a public company, anyone will be able to own a\npiece of Etsy, including our sellers, our buyers and anyone else who shares Etsy’s values and mission. These shareholders will be valued members of our community. </p>\n<p><b>Long-term sustainability </b></p> <p>We want to be a company that\nspans generations. Eighty-six of the original companies in the S&amp;P 500 index are still publicly traded after 58 years. I view going public as an important step towards providing Etsy with the capital and long-term corporate structure to achieve\nsimilar longevity. </p> <p><b>Making the world more like Etsy </b></p>\n<p>I believe that Etsy can be a public company that holistically integrates the concerns of people and the planet, the present and the future, profitability and\naccountability. If we succeed, then other companies might replicate our model.&nbsp;We think the world will be a better place for it. </p> <p>As a public\ncompany, we will continue to concentrate on the long term. Our mission to reimagine commerce is a big goal and it will take time to achieve it; success will be based on strategies that evolve over years and decades, not just quarters. We are more\nfocused on creating long-term results for us and our community than short-term results that lack that promise. </p> <p>I believe this approach will deliver the\nmost sustainable long-term returns to investors. </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>When we’re public, we do not plan to give quarterly or annual earnings guidance. I think providing\nquantitative earnings guidance is misaligned with Etsy’s mission. For example, the pressure to hit a quarterly financial target could incent us too heavily to seek near-term gains, which could diminish our ability to fulfill our larger mission\nover the long-term. </p> <p>We will continue to be transparent with our investors. Instead of providing guidance in the traditional sense, I plan to talk\nfrequently with our investors about our progress, challenges and opportunities. I welcome investors who share our long-term, community-oriented philosophy. </p>\n<p>What’s Ahead </p> <p>I am intensely grateful to all of the\npeople who have given so much of themselves to build Etsy, and I am excited to welcome new like-minded shareholders to our community. </p> <p>We are entering a\nnew era. I believe that successful businesses will be those that combine vision, execution and discipline with values, heart and conviction. That is how I plan to lead Etsy and work with our community to build a more fulfilling and lasting world\nthrough commerce. Etsy will be entering its second decade this year, and we look forward to many more in our new form as a public company. </p> <p>Onward, </p>\n <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/g806992g19e74.jpg\" alt=\"LOGO\">\n </p>\n  \n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><a target=\"_blank\"></a>Business </p>\n<p>Our Mission </p> <p>Our mission is to reimagine commerce in ways that\nbuild a more fulfilling and lasting world. </p> <p>We are building a human, authentic and community-centric global and local marketplace.

We believe many Etsy buyers are motivated by more than simply price and convenience; we believe they also value craftsmanship, artistry, uniqueness, authenticity and sustainability. We find\nthat Etsy buyers want to know how items were made, where they were made and who made them. In our marketplace, Etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and direct interactions with Etsy sellers. Etsy buyers can also purchase\ncustomized items or other bespoke goods from Etsy sellers. By buying in our marketplace, Etsy buyers are supporting creative entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world.

Much of this production is local: as of December 31, 2014,\n86% of manufacturers partnering with Etsy sellers were located in the same country as the Etsy seller. </p> <p><b>Etsy Employees </b></p>\n<p>We too are members of our community. Whether crafting our policies, talking with Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in our online forums or building the tools and\nservices underlying our marketplace, our employees create lasting, authentic connections in our community. Etsy employees emphasize building personal relationships with Etsy sellers, visiting their shops, inviting them to our offices for lunch or\ncelebrating with them at in-person events. </p> <p>Our Opportunity </p>\n<p>We operate at the center of several converging macroeconomic trends in online and mobile commerce, employment, consumption and manufacturing. We believe that\nin combination these trends will benefit millions of people in our ecosystem around the world: Etsy sellers engaging in their creative passion, working for themselves and defining success on their own terms; Etsy buyers accessing a diverse, global\nmarketplace of goods that have historically been found in highly fragmented markets; and, increasingly, responsible manufacturers using modern tools to craft goods in partnership with Etsy sellers. </p>\n <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/g806992g40s98.jpg\" alt=\"LOGO\">\n </p>  \n<p><b>Trends in Our Favor </b></p> \n <p><b>Trends in Online and Mobile Commerce </b></p>\n<p>Etsy sellers offer goods in dozens of online retail categories, including jewelry, stationery, clothing, home goods, craft supplies and vintage items.\nEuromonitor, a consumer market research company, estimated that the global online retail market was $695 billion in 2013, up from $280 billion in 2008, representing a </p>\n  <p>100 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\ncompound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 19.9%. This growth is expected to continue, with the global online retail market becoming a significantly larger portion of the total retail market,\nreaching $1.5 trillion by 2018, implying a 16.6% CAGR from 2013. </p> <p>Mobile commerce is also increasingly important in online retail. comScore estimated\nthat since the first quarter of 2013, consumers visiting online commerce sites spent more than half of their browsing time on mobile devices; however, online commerce spending via mobile devices represented only 11% of total online commerce dollars\nin the third quarter of 2014. </p> <p><b>Trends in Employment </b></p>\n<p>Whether motivated by economic necessity or personal preference, a growing number of people are turning to self-employment for their livelihoods. </p>\n<p>In a 2012 survey of middle-class households in the United States by the Pew Research Center, 85% said that it was more difficult to maintain their living\nstandards today than it was ten years ago. The erosion of middle-income jobs is not unique to the United States: we believe middle-class families in many developed countries face similar challenges. Responding to these challenges, many people\nsupplement their incomes and support their families by becoming freelancers, and freelancers are now making significant contributions to their respective economies. A study commissioned in July 2014 by the Freelancers Union and Elance-oDesk, or the\nFreelancer Study, estimated that 53&nbsp;million Americans are working as freelancers, or 34% of the U.S. workforce. The same study estimated that this freelance workforce adds $715 billion to the U.S. economy each year. </p>\n <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/g806992g74w14.jpg\" alt=\"LOGO\">\n </p>  \n<p><b>Brandi Harper, Etsy Shop: purlBknit, Brooklyn, NY </b></p> \n <p>The Freelancer Study also found that millennials\n(workers under 35) represent a source of growth in the number of Americans working as freelancers. Millennials are more likely to freelance than older workers—38% of millennials are freelancing, compared to 32% of workers over 35—and many\nmillennials have spent their entire working lives in this freelance era. Millennial freelancers are also more likely to search out work that has “a positive impact on the world” (62% of millennials vs. 54% of non-millennials) or is\n“exciting” (62% of millennials vs. 47% of non-millennials). </p>\n  <p>101 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Many other people are motivated by similar personal priorities to start their own businesses. In 2012, a Harvard\nBusiness School study found that “autonomy” was a top motivation in a faculty survey of 2,000 business founders, amongst all age cohorts and for both men and women. </p>\n<p>Women are also contributing to the trend towards self-employment. According to an October 2012 analysis by Booz and Company, by 2020, 865&nbsp;million women\nworldwide who have not previously been part of the economic mainstream will join as producers, consumers, employees and entrepreneurs. World Bank research shows that, in certain developing nations, over half of the women in the labor force are\nself-employed. </p> <p>In combination, these data underscore the importance of tools that help people start and grow their businesses. We believe that many of\nthese freelancers, millennials and women have creative skills that could provide a foundation for entrepreneurship, but that they often have little or no experience running their own businesses, and they typically lack the marketing resources, the\ntechnological expertise and the manufacturing and logistics capabilities to turn their creativity into a business. </p> <p><b>Trends in Consumption </b></p>\n<p>Most large retailers today follow the same formula, emphasizing efficiency and scale and pressuring their suppliers to reduce their costs in order to serve\nmass-produced goods at the lowest-possible prices. We believe, however, that many consumers want to purchase goods that are unique and that reflect their personality and style, not simply mass-produced, generic goods. Some consumers want their\npurchases to reflect their values; they want to support retailers and suppliers that have responsible and sustainable policies toward their employees, their communities and the environment. Finding these goods can be difficult, as markets for such\ngoods have historically been highly fragmented across boutiques, consignment stores and other venues and marketplaces. </p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/g806992g81i26.jpg\" alt=\"LOGO\">\n </p>  \n<p><b>Chris and Katie Francis, Lee Goodwin, Olivia Turrell, Etsy Shop: Docksmith, Brunswick, ME </b></p> \n <p>A 2014 Nielsen study reported that global consumers\nbetween the ages of 21 and 34 represent 51% of all consumers who are willing to pay extra for sustainable products. The Nielsen study also indicated that 55% of consumers worldwide are willing to pay extra for products and services from companies\ncommitted to social impact, a 10% increase from a similar study in 2011, and that 46% of those consumers identified support for small businesses and entrepreneurship as a key cause. </p>\n  <p>102 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Still other thoughtful consumers are looking to support their local communities and prefer buying goods that\nthey can trace to an individual person or community. According to a 2014 Havas Worldwide case study, 53% of consumers say that when possible they prefer to buy directly from an individual producer than from a store or shopping center. These\nconsumers prefer to bypass large manufacturers and retailers when possible in favor of buying locally and independently-produced goods. </p> <p><b>Trends in\nManufacturing </b></p> <p>Just as the power of computing, once reserved for government and large businesses, is now available to individuals on their personal\ncomputers and mobile devices, individuals and small businesses now have the ability to manufacture goods in their homes and studios using tools such as computer-assisted design, 3D printers, computer-controlled routers and other machines at a\nfraction of the historical cost. We believe the decrease in the size and the cost of these tools will make it easier for creative entrepreneurs to start new businesses. We also believe that small-batch manufacturers will be able to use these new\ntechnologies to provide high-quality manufacturing services to creative entrepreneurs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2011, approximately 65% of manufacturing establishments had 19 or fewer employees. Manufacturing plants that produce items\nsuch as apparel, leather, ornamental metal, furniture, printing materials, cutlery and jewelry tended to have even smaller workforces, as 80% had 19 or fewer employees. We believe that to scale their own businesses, creative entrepreneurs can access\nthis growing number of small-batch manufacturers. </p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/g806992g96f10.jpg\" alt=\"LOGO\">\n </p>  \n<p><b>Allison Faunce, Etsy Shop: Little Hero Capes, Somerset, MA </b></p> \n\n  <p>103 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Our Strengths </p>\n<p>Our platform connects millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers globally, making it one of the largest online marketplaces in the world.

Currently, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are based in nearly every country in\nthe world and our marketplace is available in 10 languages. In 2014, 30.9% of our GMS involved an Etsy seller or Etsy buyer outside of the United States. We believe our global-local marketplace creates strong competitive advantages outside the\nUnited States because our success is not dependent on scale in any given country; instead, the diverse location of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers creates the scale, and a concentration of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in any given region can give rise\nto a vibrant local Etsy marketplace. </p> <p><i>Our Seller-Aligned Business Model.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Etsy sellers are drawn to our platform because we empower them\nto succeed, and as Etsy sellers succeed, so do we. Our seller-aligned business model creates network effects. The more we invest in our platform, the more we enable Etsy sellers to pursue their craft and grow their businesses and the easier we make\nit for Etsy buyers to find unique goods. We call this Etsy’s Empowerment Loop. Some 76% of Etsy sellers consider their Etsy shops to be businesses and 90% want to grow their businesses, as indicated by our 2014 Seller Survey. We focus on\noffering Seller Services that help an Etsy seller spend more of her time on her creative passion and less of her time on the administrative aspects of running a business.

Historically, we have invested relatively small\namounts in marketing. We spent only $10.9 million on marketing in 2012 and only $17.9 million in 2013. In 2014, we began increasing our brand and digital marketing efforts and spent $39.7 million in marketing, up 122% from 2013. </p>\n<p>We plan to continue to increase our marketing spending on traditional and online media to increase awareness of our brand and attract additional members to\nour ecosystem. </p>  <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/g806992g54t54.jpg\" alt=\"LOGO\">\n </p>  \n<p><b>Visits to Etsy by Channel </b></p> \n <p>Our investment in marketing has shown early signs of\nsuccess. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we strategically increased our marketing spending in the United Kingdom, our second largest market in terms of number of active sellers, with a goal of growing the number of Etsy buyers in the United\nKingdom. In the following twelve months, we spent five times more on search engine marketing in the United Kingdom during the twelve months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 than we did during the same period in the prior year. During the twelve months\nended September&nbsp;30, 2014, the number of active buyers in the United Kingdom grew 112.9% year-over-year, compared to 89.0% year-over-year in the same period in the prior year. Additionally, Etsy buyers in the United Kingdom spent more in our\nmarketplace, with the amount spent increasing by 114.2% year-over-year versus 64.7% year-over-year in the same period in the prior year. Our success in the United Kingdom demonstrates our ability to accelerate growth with marketing improvements and\nincreased marketing spending. We intend to apply the key lessons from our experience in the United Kingdom into growing other local Etsy markets around the globe. </p>\n  <p>109 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Our Platform </p> <p>Our\nplatform is an authentic vehicle for person-to-person commerce, both globally and locally.

Our policies encourage\nEtsy sellers to be transparent about themselves, their businesses and the goods they sell. We enforce our policies through the following: </p> <p><i>Integrity\nteam</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The job of our Integrity team is to remove items that do not belong in our marketplace. We use a combination of machine learning, automated systems and community-generated queries and flags to review items and shops that may be\nin violation of our policies. </p> <p><i>Trust and Safety team</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Trust and Safety team uses human review and sophisticated automated tools and\nalgorithms to detect fraud. We cancel transactions if fraud is detected, and we strive to prohibit bad actors from using our platform. </p> <p><i>Responsible\nSeller Growth team</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Responsible Seller Growth team reviews the application of every Etsy seller who applies to work with an outside manufacturer. We do not review or approve the manufacturer; instead, we look to the Etsy seller to\nprovide evidence of authorship, responsibility and transparency. </p> <p><i>Our Case System</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers communicate via our\nCase System in instances when items do not arrive or are not as expected. Disputes are often resolved without our involvement. When necessary, we intervene, and when appropriate, we may suspend or terminate the accounts of members who do not adhere\nto our policies. </p> <p>Our Unique Engineering Culture and Approach </p>\n<p>Etsy engineering is widely known for its thought-leading approaches to software development as well as its unique engineering culture. Our engineering team\ncoined the phrase “Code as Craft” to describe our love for building software and our melding of engineering discipline and individual craftsmanship.

Our blameless\npost-mortem process is a widely-cited technique that we believe is becoming best practice among organizations that value innovation. Blameless post-mortems drive a significant percentage of our development as we analyze what about our production\nenvironment was less then optimal and rapidly make corresponding adjustments. </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Our Work Culture </p>\n<p>We pride ourselves on our values-based culture. We emphasize respect, direct communication and fun. We focus on maximizing our employees’ professional\nand personal well-being. We evaluate performance not just on traditional business metrics, but also on societal and environmental goals and on adherence to our mission and values. </p>\n<p>We believe employee happiness comes from engaging and fulfilling work and from ample personal and professional growth opportunities. We invest heavily in\nemployee development by offering coaching, skills workshops and training. We actively encourage personal education through arts and crafts workshops and employee-taught classes called “Etsy School,” covering subjects ranging from screen\nprinting to Python programming. </p> <p>As of December 31, 2014, we had 685&nbsp;employees worldwide, with 430 in our offices in Brooklyn, New York. Of those\nemployees, we had 153 in member operations, 332 in product and engineering, 89 in marketing and 111 in corporate. Our product development expenses were $18.7&nbsp;million, $27.5&nbsp;million and $36.6 million in the years ended December&nbsp;31,\n2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. </p> <p>We proactively work and recruit to improve the gender balance at all levels of our company. As of December&nbsp;31,\n2014, 51% of employees identified as female.

In particular, Etsy.org will focus on educating women and other\nunder-represented entrepreneurial populations and empowering them to build businesses that regenerate communities and the planet. In January 2015, we issued 376,471 shares of our common stock to Etsy.org, and we expect to use $300,000 of the\nproceeds of this offering to partially fund Etsy.org. </p> <p>Competition </p>\n<p>We compete with retailers for the Etsy seller. An Etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers or sell her goods through local consignment\nand vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces. She may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers, including large national retailers, who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise. We also compete with companies that sell\nsoftware and services to small businesses, enabling an Etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform. We are able to compete for Etsy sellers based on our brand awareness, the breadth of our\nonline presence, the number and engagement of Etsy buyers, our Seller Services, our fees, the strength of our community and our values. </p> <p>We also compete\nwith retailers for the attention of the Etsy buyer. An Etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or\nmarketplaces. We are able to compete for Etsy buyers based on the unique goods that Etsy sellers list in our marketplace, awareness of our brand, the person-to-person commerce experience, our reputation for authenticity, our mobile apps, ease of\npayment and the availability and reliability of our platform. </p> <p>Intellectual Property </p>\n<p>Protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, primarily including\ntrade secret, copyright and trademark laws in the United States and abroad, and we use confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. </p>\n<p>While we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of\nprotecting intellectual property. We register domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad. We also rely upon common law protection for certain trademarks. </p>\n  <p>115 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Circumstances beyond our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual\nproperty protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. In addition, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our\nintellectual property rights could harm our business, our ability to compete and our operating results. </p> <p>Facilities </p>\n<p>Our headquarters are located in Brooklyn, New York where we occupy approximately 104,493 square feet under a lease that expires in 2016. We use these\nfacilities for our principal administration, technology and development and engineering activities. Our European headquarters are located in Dublin, Ireland. </p>\n<p>In May 2014, we signed a lease for new corporate headquarters, also located in Brooklyn, which we expect to occupy in 2016. The lease covers two buildings\ntotaling approximately 198,635 square feet and will expire approximately ten years from the later to occur of the two buildings’ lease commencement dates. We expect that our new space will allow us to grow our local staff, will be\nLEED-certified and will support our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint. </p> <p>We also maintain offices in Hudson (New York), San Francisco, Berlin,\nDublin, London, Paris, Melbourne and Toronto. </p> <p>We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our ongoing needs and that, if we\nrequire additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities. </p> <p>Government Regulation </p>\n<p>As with any company operating on the Internet, we grapple with a growing number of local, national and international laws and regulations. These laws are\noften complex, sometimes contradict other laws, and are frequently still evolving. Laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world, posing a significant challenge to our global business. For example, U.S.\nfederal and state laws, EU directives, and other national laws govern the processing of payments, consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information; other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices. Still other laws\ndictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected. Laws of defamation apply online and vary by country. The growing regulation of e-commerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and\ncosts on us or on Etsy sellers, and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply. Additionally, because we operate internationally, we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the United\nStates, including anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and export control laws. </p>\n  <p>116 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Legal Matters </p>\n<p>From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.

In 2014, our compensation committee approved an\nannual cash incentive plan in which certain of our employees, including our named executive officers, participated. The bonus plan was funded based upon the satisfaction of company-wide Adjusted EBITDA margin and net revenue goals. Because we\nexceeded our Adjusted EBITDA margin goal, the bonus plan was funded above target. The target bonuses for our named executive officers for 2014, as a percentage of base salary, were 75% for Mr.&nbsp;Dickerson, 59% for Ms.&nbsp;Salen and 50% for\nMr.&nbsp;Breslow, and the actual bonus payouts were 110% of target for Mr.&nbsp;Dickerson and 121% of target for Ms.&nbsp;Salen and Mr.&nbsp;Breslow. The individual bonus payments were approved by our compensation committee and our board of\ndirectors with input from Mr.&nbsp;Dickerson for the other named executive officers. </p> <p><b>Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation </b></p>\n<p>We grant stock options to our employees, including our named executive officers, as the long-term equity incentive component of our compensation program.\nStock options allow employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a price no less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and are generally granted to employees in connection with their commencement of employment.\nOur board of directors or compensation committee from time to time also grants stock options to certain employees who have had a long tenure at Etsy, who have taken on significant new responsibilities or as a reward for superior performance.\nEmployee stock options generally vest 25% when an employee completes 12 months of service with us and then in equal monthly installments over the following 36 months of service with us. None of our named executive officers received stock options in\n2014. </p> <p>In January 2015, we granted an option to purchase 600,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Dickerson and an option to purchase 290,000 shares of\nour common stock to Ms. Salen. The options vest 25% upon Mr. Dickerson’s or Ms. Salen’s 12 months of continuous service from January 30, 2015 and then in equal monthly installments over his or her following 36 months of service with us.\n</p> <p>For information regarding the vesting acceleration provisions applicable to the options held by our named executive officers, see “—Change in\nControl Benefits” below. </p> <p><b>Employee Benefits and Perquisites </b></p>\n<p>Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our health and welfare plans to the same extent as other\nfull-time employees generally. We generally do not provide our named executive officers with perquisites or other personal benefits. From time to time, however, we provide relocation benefits to new executive\nofficers. </p>\n  <p>128 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a

In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be set only by resolution adopted by a majority vote\nof our entire board of directors. These provisions will prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees. </p>\n<p><i>Classified Board</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that our board of\ndirectors will be classified into three classes of directors, each of whom will hold office for a three-year term. In addition, directors may only be removed from our board of directors for </p>\n  <p>154 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\ncause and only by the approval of our then outstanding shares of our common stock. The existence of a classified board could delay a successful tender offeror from obtaining majority control of\nour board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential offeror. </p> <p><i>Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of\nStockholders</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that stockholders will not be able to take action by written consent, and will only be able to take action at annual or special meetings of our\nstockholders. Stockholders will not be permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated bylaws will further provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our\nentire board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer. </p> <p><i>Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder\nProposals and Director Nominations</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our amended and restated bylaws will provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as\ndirectors at any meeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws will also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder’s notice. These provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters\nbefore our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at our meetings of stockholders. </p> <p><i>Issuance of Undesignated\nPreferred Stock</i><i>.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by the holders of common stock, to issue up to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares of undesignated preferred stock with\nrights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock will enable our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage\nan attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. </p> <p><b>Choice of Forum </b></p>\n<p>Upon the completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\nwill be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended\nand restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other\ncompanies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. </p>\n  <p>155 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Transfer Agent and Registrar </p>\n<p>Upon the completion of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock will be&nbsp;American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, LLC.\nThe transfer agent’s address is&nbsp;6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, and its telephone number is&nbsp;(800) 937-5449. </p> <p>Listing </p>\n<p>We intend to apply to have our common stock listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ETSY.” </p>\n  <p>156 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><a target=\"_blank\"></a>Shares Available for Future Sale </p>\n<p>Before this offering, there has not been a public market for shares of our common stock.

We believe that we are not and we do not anticipate becoming a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </p>\n<p>Withholdable Payments to Foreign Financial Institutions and Other Non-U.S. Entities </p>\n<p>The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain payments to foreign financial institutions,\ninvestment funds and certain other non-U.S. persons that fail to comply with certain information reporting and certification requirements pertaining to their direct and indirect U.S. securityholders and/or U.S. accountholders. Such payments would\ninclude our dividends and the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common stock. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, this withholding will apply to payments of dividends on our common stock, and to payments of gross proceeds\nfrom a sale or other disposition of our common stock made on or after January&nbsp;1, 2017. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in\nour common stock. </p> <p>Backup Withholding, Information Reporting and Other Reporting Requirements </p>\n<p>We must report annually to the Internal Revenue Service and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends paid to, and the tax withheld with respect to,\neach non-U.S. holder. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Copies of this information reporting may also be made available under the provisions of a specific tax\ntreaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. </p>\n  <p>162 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>A non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to backup withholding for dividends on our common stock paid to such\nholder unless such holder certifies under penalties of perjury (generally by providing an applicable Internal Revenue Service form W-8) that, among other things, it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know\nthat such holder is a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes an exemption. </p> <p>Information reporting and backup withholding generally are not required with\nrespect to the amount of any proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder outside the United States through an office outside the United States of a non-U.S. broker that does not have certain specified\nconnections to the United States. However, if a non-U.S. holder sells or otherwise disposes of its shares of common stock through a U.S. broker or the U.S. offices of a non-U.S. broker, the broker will generally be required to report the amount of\nproceeds paid to the non-U.S. holder to the Internal Revenue Service and also backup withhold on that amount unless such non-U.S. holder provides appropriate certification to the broker of its status as a non-U.S. person (and the payor does not have\nactual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes an exemption. Information reporting will also apply if a non-U.S. holder sells its shares of common stock through a non-U.S. broker deriving more than a\nspecified percentage of its income from U.S. sources or having certain other connections to the United States, unless such broker has documentary evidence in its records that such non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. person (and the payor does not have\nactual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person) and certain other conditions are met, or such non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption. </p>\n<p>Backup withholding is not an additional income tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. holder generally can\nbe credited against the non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, or refunded, provided that the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax\nadvisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them. </p>\n  <p>163 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p><a target=\"_blank\"></a>Underwriting </p>\n<p>The company, the selling stockholders and the underwriters named below have entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the shares being offered.\nSubject to certain conditions, each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase the number of shares indicated in the following table.

This agreement does not apply to any existing employee benefit plans. See “Shares Available for Future Sale” for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions. </p>\n<p>Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares. The initial public offering price will be negotiated among the company and the\nrepresentative. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be the company’s historical performance, estimates of the business potential\nand earnings prospects of the company, an assessment of the company’s management and the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses. </p>\n<p>The company intends to apply to list the common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ETSY.” </p>\n<p>In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short\nsales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering, and a short position\nrepresents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A “covered short position” is a short position that is not greater than the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters’ option\ndescribed above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to cover the covered\nshort position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option described above.\n“Naked” short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the amount of additional shares for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked short position by\npurchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely\naffect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. </p>\n<p>The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount\nreceived by it because the representative has repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. </p>\n<p>Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect\nof preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the company’s stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or </p>\n  <p>165 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>\notherwise affect the market price of the common stock.

Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the issuer and to persons and\nentities with relationships with the issuer, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.

Consolidated Financial Statements </p> <p><b>Note 1—Basis\nof Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies </b></p> <p><b><i>Description of Business </i></b></p>\n<p>Etsy, Inc. (the “Company” or “Etsy”) was incorporated in Delaware in February 2006. Etsy operates a marketplace where people around the\nworld connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. The Company generates revenue primarily from transaction and listing fees, Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout fees, and Shipping Label sales. </p>\n<p><b><i>Evaluation of Subsequent Events </i></b></p> <p>The Company has\nevaluated subsequent events that occurred after December 31, 2014 through March 4, 2015, the date on which the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 were issued. </p>\n<p><b><i>Basis of Consolidation </i></b></p> <p>The consolidated\nfinancial statements include the accounts of Etsy and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The 2012 and 2013 financial statements have been revised to correct certain\nerrors. See Note 15—Revisions to Consolidated Financial Statements. </p> <p><b><i>Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information </i></b></p>\n<p>Upon the consummation of the initial public offering contemplated by the Company, all of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock will convert\ninto shares of common stock. The December 31, 2014 unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet data has been prepared assuming the conversion of the outstanding convertible preferred stock into 106,896,493 shares of common stock. </p>\n<p><b><i>Use of Estimates </i></b></p> <p>The preparation of the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting estimates that require management’s\nmost difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition, income taxes, website development costs and internal-use software, purchase price allocations for business combinations, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and stock based\ncompensation. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and revises them when necessary. Actual results may differ from the original or revised estimates. </p>\n  <p>F-10 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n <p>Etsy, Inc. </p>\n<p>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements </p> \n <p><b><i>Revenue Recognition </i></b></p>\n<p>The Company operates a platform for third-party sellers. Its business model is based on shared success: the Company makes money when Etsy sellers make money.\nThe Company does not compete with Etsy sellers, hold inventory or sell goods. The Company’s revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services the Company provides Etsy sellers to help them create and grow\ntheir businesses. The Company’s revenue consists of Marketplace revenue, Seller Services revenue and Other revenue. The Company’s revenue is recorded net of actual and expected refunds. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller\npays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment\nprocessing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through the Company’s platform via Shipping Labels. The Company deducts its cost of shipping labels and estimated refunds from gross shipping fees to determine net shipping fees.\nOther revenue includes the fees the Company receives from a third-party payment processor. </p> <p>The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following\nconditions are satisfied: (1)&nbsp;there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2)&nbsp;the service has been provided to the Etsy seller; (3)&nbsp;the collection of fees is reasonably assured; and (4)&nbsp;the amount of fees to be paid by the\nEtsy seller is fixed or determinable. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether it is the primary obligor in a transaction, has inventory risk and has latitude\nin establishing pricing and selecting suppliers. Based on its evaluation of these factors, revenue is recorded net of merchandise values associated with the transaction. </p>\n<p><i>Marketplace revenue</i>. Marketplace revenue consists of the 3.5% fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on the Company’s\nplatform, exclusive of shipping fees charged. Marketplace revenue also consists of a listing fee of $0.20 per item that she lists in its marketplace. Revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is also included in Marketplace revenue, whereas\nrevenue from Wholesale enrollment is included in Seller Services revenue. Transaction fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is made. Listing fees are recognized ratably over a four-month listing period, unless the item is sold or\nthe seller relists it, at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized. </p> <p><i>Seller Services revenue</i>. Seller Services revenue consists of fees\nan Etsy seller pays the Company for the Seller Services she uses, including Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout, Shipping Labels and Wholesale enrollment. </p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Revenue from Promoted Listings consists of cost-per-click based fees an Etsy seller pays the Company for prominent placement of her listings in search results generated by Etsy buyers in its marketplace.

Direct Checkout fees vary between 3-4% of the item’s total sale price plus a flat\nfee per order, depending on the country in which her bank account is located. Direct Checkout fees are based on the item’s total sale price, including shipping. Revenue from Direct Checkout is recognized when the corresponding transaction is\nmade. Revenue from breakage on Etsy Gift Cards is recognized when the amount is probable and estimable. Given the lack of historical experience related to gift card activity, there has been no breakage revenue recorded to date. </td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Revenue from Shipping Labels consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company when she purchases shipping labels directly through its platform, net of the cost it incurs in purchasing those shipping labels. The Company\nprovides its sellers shipping labels from the United States Postal Service and Canada Post at a discounted price due to the volume of purchases through its platform. The Company recognizes Shipping Label revenue when an Etsy seller purchases a\nshipping label. The Company recognizes Shipping Label revenue on a net basis as it is not the primary obligor in the delivery of these services. </td></tr></tbody></table> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"2%\" valign=\"top\">•</td>\n<td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Revenue from Wholesale consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company when she is approved to enroll in its Wholesale program.

The Company capitalizes construction in\nprogress for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are the owner, for accounting purposes only, during the construction period. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of\ndepreciable and amortizable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. </p>\n<p><b><i>Internal-use Software and Website Development Costs </i></b></p>\n<p>Costs incurred to develop software for internal use and the Company’s website are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the\nsoftware, generally three years. The Company also capitalizes costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the useful life of existing functionality. Costs\nrelated to the design or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are expensed as incurred. The Company periodically reviews internal-use software and website development costs to determine whether the projects will be completed,\nplaced in service, removed from service, or replaced by other internally developed or third-party software. If the asset is not expected to provide any future benefit, the asset is retired and any unamortized cost is expensed. </p>\n<p><b><i>Depreciable/Amortizable Tangible Long-Lived Assets </i></b></p>\n<p>When events or changes in circumstances require, the Company assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of tangible long-lived assets based on its\nexpectations of future profitability, undiscounted cash flows and management’s plans with respect to operations to determine if the asset is impaired and subject to write-off. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the\ncarrying value of the asset over the fair value. </p> <p><b><i>Leases </i></b></p>\n<p>The Company leases office space and certain computer equipment in multiple locations under non-cancelable lease agreements. The leases are reviewed for\nclassification as operating or capital leases. For operating leases, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease period. For capital leases, the Company records the leased asset with a corresponding liability. Payments are recorded as\nreductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on the then-outstanding remaining liability. </p> <p>The Company considers the\nnature of the renovations and the Company’s involvement during the construction period of newly leased office space to determine if it is considered to be the owner of the </p>\n  <p>F-14 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n <p>Etsy, Inc. </p>\n<p>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements </p> \n <p>\nconstruction project during the construction period. If the Company determines that it is the owner of the construction project, it is required to capitalize the fair value of the building as\nwell as the construction costs incurred on its consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability (“build-to-suit accounting”). Upon occupancy for build-to-suit leases, the Company assesses whether the circumstances\nqualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the lease meets the sale-leaseback criteria, the Company will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an\noperating lease. If upon completion of construction, the project does not meet the sale-leaseback criteria, the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes. </p>\n<p><b><i>Business Combinations </i></b></p> <p>The Company has completed\na number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price, which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash, equity or a combination of the two, in a business combination to the identifiable assets and\nliabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies.\n</p> <p>When the Company issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company’s stockholders, the Company evaluates whether the awards are contingent\nconsideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company’s stockholder beyond the acquisition\ndate. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period. </p>\n<p>The Company carries intangible assets at cost, and it amortizes them on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically three years. When\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the Company reviews its identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment. </p>\n<p>To date, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Company’s business combinations have primarily consisted of goodwill and finite-lived\nintangible assets, consisting primarily of developed technologies, customer relationships and trademarks.

The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including market conditions,\ntechnological developments, economic conditions and competition. In connection with determination of fair values, the Company may engage independent appraisal firms to assist with the valuation of intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and\ncertain assumed obligations. </p> <p>Acquisition-related transaction costs incurred by the Company are not included as a component of consideration transferred,\nbut are accounted for as an expense in the period in which the costs are incurred. </p> <p><b><i>Goodwill </i></b></p>\n<p>Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets\nacquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Management has determined that the Company has a single reporting unit and performs its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth\nquarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired. </p> <p>Events or changes in circumstances which\ncould trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the manner of the Company’s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Company’s overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant\nunderperformance relative to historical or projected future results of operations, a significant adverse change in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition or a loss of key personnel. </p>\n<p>The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it\nis more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first of a two-step impairment test. </p>\n<p>The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair\nvalue exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then a second step is required that compares the carrying amount of\nthe goodwill with its implied fair value.

If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an\namount equal to the excess. </p> <p>The Company completed a Step 1 analysis during the fourth quarter of 2014. No impairment of goodwill was recorded at\nDecember&nbsp;31, 2013 or 2014. </p> <p><b><i>Intangible Assets </i></b></p>\n<p>Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the acquired technology, customer relationships and trademarks, generally three years. </p>\n<p><b><i>Stock-Based Compensation </i></b></p> <p>For employee\nstock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest. For non-employee stock-based\nawards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant in the same manner as employee awards over the contractual term; however, the unvested portion of the awards is revalued at the end of each reporting period until such\ntime as the non-employee award is fully vested. </p> <p>We account for stock-based compensation arrangements in restricted shares, subject to a put option that\nallows the holder of the shares to put the shares back to the Company for cash, as liability-classified stock awards. These awards are re-measured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value being charged to the statement of operations.\nCompensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting methodology for each separately vesting tranche as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. Unless the put option is exercised, the restricted shares will be reclassified from a\nliability to an equity classified award upon the termination of the put option. </p> <p>For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the Company\nrecognized expenses of approximately $3.9 million, $3.7 million and $5.9 million for employee stock options, respectively, and $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million for non-employee stock options, respectively. </p>\n<p>Additionally, the Company recorded $4.1 million in acquisition-related stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, of which\n$3.4 million relates to liability-classified awards. </p> <p><b><i>Cash and Cash Equivalents </i></b></p>\n<p>The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. </p>\n  <p>F-17 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n <p>Etsy, Inc. </p>\n<p>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements </p> \n <p><b><i>Concentration of Credit Risk </i></b></p>\n<p>Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company reduces credit\nrisk by placing its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions with high credit ratings. At times, such amounts may exceed Federally insured limits. </p>\n<p><b><i>Fair Value of Financial Instruments </i></b></p> <p>Management\nbelieves that the fair value of financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximates carrying value due to the immediate or short-term maturity associated with its cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. </p> <p><b><i>Income Taxes </i></b></p>\n<p>Income tax benefit (provision) is based on (loss) income before income taxes and is accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets\nand liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management assesses the need for a valuation allowance on an annual basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be\nrealized. </p> <p>The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement\nrecognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized\nis measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. The Company has no unrecognized tax benefits at December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013 and has an unrecognized tax benefit\nof $0.4 million at December 31, 2014. </p> <p>The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, associated with income tax matters as part of the income\ntax provision and includes accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability in the consolidated balance sheet. </p>\n  <p>F-18 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n <p>Etsy, Inc. </p>\n<p>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements </p> \n <p><b><i>Marketing </i></b></p>\n<p>Marketing expenses consist primarily of targeted online marketing costs, such as search engine marketing, and offline marketing expenses, such as television\nadvertising. Marketing expenses also include employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees involved in marketing, public relations and communications activities. Marketing expenses are expensed as incurred.\n</p> <p><b><i>Net (Loss) Income Per Share </i></b></p> <p>The Company\nfollows the two-class method when computing net (loss) income per share as the Company has issued shares that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net (loss) income per share for each class of common stock\nand participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock\nand participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. </p> <p>The\nCompany’s convertible preferred stock contractually entitles the holders of such shares to participate in dividends, but does not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in losses of the Company. Accordingly, the\ntwo-class method does not apply for periods in which the Company reports a net loss or a net loss attributable to common stockholders resulting from dividends, accretion or modifications to its convertible preferred stock. </p>\n<p>Basic net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by\nthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to reallocate undistributed\nearnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities, including outstanding common stock options, convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock and convertible preferred stock. </p>\n<p>Diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net (loss) income attributable to common\nstockholders by the weighted average number of common shares, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding common stock options, convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock and\nconvertible preferred stock. For periods in which the Company has reported net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, because dilutive\ncommon shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. </p>\n  <p>F-19 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n <p>Etsy, Inc. </p>\n<p>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements </p> \n <p><b><i>Segment Data </i></b></p>\n<p>The Company identifies operating segments as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the\nchief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company defines the term “chief operating decision maker” to be its chief executive officer. The\nCompany has determined it operates in one operating segment and one reportable segment, as its chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on only a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating\nfinancial performance. </p> <p><b><i>Foreign Currency </i></b></p>\n<p>The Company has determined that the functional currency for each of its foreign operations is the local currency in which the operation is located. All\nassets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are\nreflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are\nincluded in foreign exchange loss within other (expense) income in the statement of operations. </p> <p><b><i>Excess Tax Benefits from Exercise of Stock Options\n</i></b></p> <p>The Company uses the “with and without” approach in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, the\nCompany recognizes a tax benefit from stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to the Company have been utilized. When tax deductions from\nstock-based awards are less than the cumulative book compensation expense, the tax effect of the resulting difference (“shortfall”) is charged first to additional paid-in capital, to the extent of the Company’s pool of windfall tax\nbenefits, with any remainder recognized in income tax expense. The Company determined that it had a sufficient windfall pool available through December 31, 2014 to absorb any shortfalls. </p>\n<p><b><i>Recent Accounting Pronouncements </i></b></p> <p>Under the\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”), the Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company.

The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. </p>\n<p>In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the updated guidance\nrequires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January&nbsp;1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. </p>\n<p>In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update under which management will be required to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern and provide related disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after&nbsp;December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not\nexpected to have an impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. </p> <p><b>Note 2—Business Combinations </b></p>\n<p>In April 2012, the Company acquired the assets of Trunkt LLC for a purchase price of $200,000, plus two additional contingent payments of $100,000 that were\ntied to continued employment with the Company and were recognized as post-acquisition compensation expense and paid out by the Company in 2013. Acquired assets consisted of customer information, domain access rights, certain web services and a\ntrademark.

The fair value of the Company’s customer\nrelationships was determined primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned to trademark was determined using the\nrelief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized.

The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily by using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair\nvalue of the Company’s customer relationships was determined primarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned\nto trademark was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible\nassets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. Goodwill of $27.3 million, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, was recorded in connection with the ALM\nacquisition, which is primarily attributed to synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of the acquired workforce. </p> <p>The Company incurred\napproximately $2.1 million in acquisition-related costs, included in general and administrative expenses. These acquisitions increased revenue by $1.8&nbsp;million and contributed $5.7 million to the Company’s consolidated net loss in the year\nended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The impact to net loss was primarily due to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation associated with the acquisitions. </p>\n<p>The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined operating results of the Company, Grand St. and ALM as if each acquisition had\noccurred as of January&nbsp;1, 2013.

The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness,\nliens, investments, mergers, dispositions, transactions with affiliates and dividends and other distributions. These restrictions do not prohibit a subsidiary of the Company from making pro rata payments to the Company or any other person that owns\nan equity interest in such subsidiary. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain a total leverage ratio (defined as net debt to adjusted EBITDA) not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. </p>\n<p>The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including a change in control and a cross-default on the Company’s material indebtedness.

Under the Stock Plan, incentive and nonqualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term of 10\nyears. Options granted under the Stock Plan generally vest 25% after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36-month period contingent on continued employment with the Company on each vesting date. At December&nbsp;31,\n2013 and 2014, 43,432,935 and 48,505,935 shares were authorized under the Stock Plan, respectively, and 3,063,945 and 3,036,004 shares were available for future grant, respectively. </p>\n<p>The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Since the Company is not publicly traded,\nthe Company utilizes equity valuations based on comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted free cash flows, an analysis of the Company’s enterprise value and any other factors deemed relevant in estimating the fair value of its common\nstock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from market comparisons of certain\npublicly traded companies and other factors. The expected term of stock options granted has been determined using the simplified method, which uses the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual term. The requisite service period is\ngenerally four years from the date of grant. </p> <p>The fair value of options granted in each year using the Black-Scholes pricing model has been based on the\nfollowing assumptions: </p> \n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\n\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"64%\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"

Statements </p> \n <p>As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company had approximately $10.6 million and $5.0 million of federal and\npre-apportionment New York City net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards, respectively, as well as immaterial amounts of NOLs in other state and local jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $6.9 million and\n$4.3 million of federal and preapportionment New York City NOL carryforwards, respectively, as well as immaterial amounts of NOLs in other states. The federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2031 if unused. The New York City NOLs will expire in 2033 if\nunused. All of the federal NOLs and most of the other NOL carryforwards are attributable to excess tax deductions from stock option exercises. The benefit of these NOLs will be credited to additional paid in capital when the NOLs are utilized. </p>\n<p>As of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2014, the Company had approximately $0.2&nbsp;million of federal alternative minimum tax credits, which may be carried\nforward indefinitely. </p> <p>The utilization of the Company’s NOL carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal\nRevenue Code due to a change of ownership. However, the Company does not believe such annual limitation will impact its realization of the NOL carryforwards. </p>\n<p>The Company assesses the likelihood of its ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by evaluating all relevant positive\nand negative evidence. To the extent the Company determines that some or all of its deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized, it establishes a valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company determined\nthat the existence of a three-year cumulative loss incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions, inclusive of 2014, constituted sufficiently strong negative evidence to warrant the establishment of a valuation allowance. As a result, a valuation\nallowance of $1.9 million as of December 31, 2014 has been recorded against certain of the Company’s deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable is $7.2 million. </p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the valuation allowance activity for the periods indicated (in thousands):

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the\ninvestments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the investment. Investments recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet\nare categorized based on the inputs to valuation techniques as follows: </p> <p>Level 1—These are investments where values are based on\nunadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that the Company has the ability to access. </p> <p>Level 2—These are\ninvestments where values are based on quoted market prices in markets that are not active or model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. </p>\n<p>Level 3—These are liabilities where values are derived from techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. </p>\n<p>The following are the major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2014 using\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2) and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands): </p> \n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\n\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"61%\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"

respectively, for certain non-income tax\nobligations, representing management’s best estimate of its liability. In addition, the Company could be subject to examination in various jurisdictions related to income and non-income tax matters. The resolution of these types of matters,\ngiving recognition to the recorded reserve, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. </p> <p><i>Legal Proceedings </i></p>\n<p>From time to time in the normal course of business, various claims and litigation have been asserted or commenced against the Company. Due to uncertainties\ninherent in litigation and other claims, the Company can give no assurance that it will prevail in any such matters, which could subject the Company to significant liability for damages. Any claims or litigation, regardless of their success, could\nhave an adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period the claims or litigation are resolved. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company does not believe that there are any material litigation\nexposures. </p> <p><b>Note 15—Revisions to Consolidated Financial Statements </b></p>\n<p>In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company determined that its prior years’ annual consolidated financial statements included an understatement in\ncertain non-income tax-related expenses.

The Company assessed the effect of the errors on prior\nperiods’ financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 99—Materiality and SAB No. 108—Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year\nFinancial Statements. Based on quantitative and qualitative factors, the Company determined that the errors were not material to any previously issued annual consolidated financial statements. The Company determined that the correction of the\ncumulative amounts of the errors would be material to the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and, as such, has revised its previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2012 and 2013. The\nadjustments related to years prior to 2012 are reflected as a $0.1 million adjustment to beginning accumulated deficit for fiscal year 2012. All financial information contained in the accompanying notes to these financial statements has been revised\nto reflect the correction of these errors. </p> <p>The effects of the adjustments on the

responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud\nor error. </p> <p>Auditor’s Responsibility </p> <p>Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. </p> <p>An audit involves\nperforming procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in\nthe circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies\nused and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to\nprovide a basis for our audit opinion. </p>\n  <p>F-54 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a

Organization </b></p> <p><b>Organization and Nature of Business\n</b></p> <p>Jarvis Labs, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on June&nbsp;11, 2012 (inception). The Company owns and\noperates Grandst.com, a website that provides a marketplace for creative new technology and merchandise. The Company generates revenue through direct retail sales. The Company is based in New York, NY and operates in the United States. </p>\n<p><b>Unaudited Interim Financial Information </b></p> <p>The\naccompanying balance sheet as of March&nbsp;31, 2014, the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss and cash flows for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2014, and the statement of changes in convertible preferred stock and\nstockholders’ deficit for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect\nall adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position as of March&nbsp;31, 2014 and results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013 and\n2014. The financial data and the other information disclosed in these notes to the financial statements related to these three-month periods are unaudited. </p>\n<p><b>Use of Estimates </b></p> <p>The preparation of financial\nstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The accounting estimates that require management’s most difficult and subjective judgments include the\nuseful life and recoverability of fixed assets, the fair value of options issued for services and the fair value of warrants. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and revises when necessary. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. </p> <p><b>Revenue Recognition </b></p>\n<p>The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has\noccurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. </p>\n  <p>F-60 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n <p>Jarvis Labs, Inc. </p>\n<p>Notes to the Financial Statements </p> \n <p>The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related\ncosts or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, the Company is the primary obligor in its sales to customers, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers and maintains inventory risk, and therefore revenue is recorded at\nthe gross sales price. </p> <p>Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of\npromotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. </p> <p><b>Cost of Sales\n</b></p> <p>Cost of sales consists of the purchase price of products sold, inbound shipping and duty charges and credit card processing fees. Shipping charges\nto receive products from the Company’s suppliers are included in the Company’s inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to the Company’s customers. </p>\n<p><b>Cash and Cash Equivalents </b></p> <p>The Company considers all\nshort-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. </p> <p><b>Inventory </b></p>\n<p>The Company’s inventory is comprised of finished goods and are valued at the lower of average cost or market, and are evaluated periodically for product\nobsolescence, excess balances and other indications of impairment in value. </p> <p><b>Property and Equipment </b></p>\n<p>Property and equipment consisting of office furniture, office and computer equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Property and equipment\nis depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. </p> <p><b>Fair Value Measurement </b></p>\n<p>The Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value based on inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in\npricing an asset or a liability. ASC Topic 820, <i>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</i>, defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, management considers the principal or most advantageous market in which </p>\n  <p>F-61 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n <p>Jarvis Labs, Inc. </p>\n<p>Notes to the Financial Statements </p> \n <p>\nthe Company would transact, and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of\nnon-performance. </p> <p>ASC Topic 820 further requires disclosures on the amount and reason for transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements.\nThe standards also require disclosure of activities, including purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements within the Level 3 fair value measurements. The standards also clarify existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and\ndisclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. This pronouncement requires disclosure regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three-tiered value hierarchy into which these assets and\nliabilities are grouped, based upon significant inputs as follows: </p> <p>Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n</p> <p>Level 2—Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. </p>\n<p>Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThis includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within Level 3, the determination is based upon\nthe lack of significance of the observable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, the fair value determination for Level 3 financial instruments may consider some observable market inputs. </p>\n<p>The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. </p>\n<p>The following table reflects the activity for the Company’s major classes of liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs:

that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may\nrequire revision, or that the remaining balance of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future\ncash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived asset group in measuring whether they are recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, a loss is recorded to the extent the asset\ngroup’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.

The Company estimates the expected life of stock options granted based on the simplified method, which the Company believes is representative of future behavior.

The Company selected the risk-free interest rate based on yields from United States Treasury zero-coupon issues for a term consistent with the expected life of the\nawards in effect at the time of grant. The Company estimates the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience of the stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and canceled. </p>\n<p>The Company may, from time to time, grant stock options to non-employees. For non-employee stock options, the Company calculates the fair value of the award\non the date of grant in the same manner as employee awards, however the unvested portion of the awards are revalued at the end of each reporting period and the pro-rata compensation expense is adjusted accordingly until such time the non-employee\naward is fully vested.

At December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013 and for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2014 the fair values of these instruments approximated their financial statement carrying amounts due to their relatively short-term nature. </p> <p><b>Income Taxes </b></p>\n<p>The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary\ndifferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related assets or liabilities for financial reporting, or according to the expected reversal dates of the specific temporary differences if not related to an\nasset or liability for financial reporting. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. </p>\n<p>As of December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. Consequently, the Company has not\nrecognized deferred income tax assets or liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. </p>\n<p>The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties expense, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company’s uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. As of December 31, 2013, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions. </p>\n  <p>F-65 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n\n <p>Jarvis Labs, Inc. </p>\n<p>Notes to the Financial Statements </p> \n <p><b>2.

Stock options expire either four or ten years from the date of the grant. For initial grants,\nvesting occurs over either (i)&nbsp;two years, with vesting occurring immediately each month, or (ii)&nbsp;four years, with the first 25% of the awards vesting twelve months after the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% of the awards\nvesting monthly over the next thirty-six months.

(the “Company”) completed the acquisition of Jarvis Labs, Inc., owners of the “Grand St.” online\ntechnology marketplace. Total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $3.2 million, consisting of $1.0 million in cash and 425,104 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $2.2 million on the acquisition date.\nAdditionally, the Company issued 657,160 shares of common stock with a fair value of $3.4 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based\ncompensation expense over the three-year vesting period. </p> <p>On June&nbsp;18, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Incubart SAS, a societe par\nactions simplifiee organized under the laws of France, which operates the online marketplace A Little Market (“ALM”). Total consideration for the acquisition was $30.8 million, consisting of $5.3 million in cash, of which $4.2 million was\npaid at closing, $0.3 million will be paid in March 2015 and $0.8 million in February 2016, and 4,879,693 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $25.5 million on the acquisition date. The terms of the purchase agreement\nprovide for the sale of put options to certain of the former shareholders of ALM. The put options enable the holders of the options to sell up to all of their shares back to the Company, subject to certain vesting and restrictions, at fair value,\nbut not to exceed $4.13 per share and not less than $2.00 per share. The put right terminates with respect to a share on the earlier of one year from when such share is vested or the liquidation date, as defined in the agreement containing the put\noption. The holders of the options paid an aggregate of $0.1 million cash to the Company at the date of acquisition and the Company recorded a $0.1 million liability for the fair value of the put option at the time. Additionally, the Company issued\n1,198,995 shares of common stock with a fair value of $6.3 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense over the three-year\nvesting period. Since the put options relate in part to these shares, these shares will be recorded as liability-classified stock awards as earned. </p> <p>The\nhistorical financial information for Etsy is derived from the Company’s audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 2014 contained in this prospectus. The historical financial information of Grand St. and ALM has\nbeen derived from the historical audited financial statements and the unaudited financial statements of Grand St. and ALM for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2014 through April 29, 2014 and the period from January 1, 2014 through June 18, 2014,\nrespectively.

Pro forma adjustments are\nthose that are directly attributable to the transactions, are factually supportable and, with respect to the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations, are expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results.

Forma Combined Financial information </p>\n<p><b>Note 1—Basis of Presentation </b></p> <p>The unaudited pro\nforma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was derived from the audited financial statements of Etsy, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2014, the unaudited financial statements of Grand St.\nfor the period from January&nbsp;1, 2014 through April&nbsp;29, 2014 and the unaudited financial statements of ALM for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2014 through June&nbsp;18, 2014. </p>\n<p>The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 gives effect to the acquisitions as if they each occurred\non January&nbsp;1, 2014. </p> <p>The Company prepared the unaudited pro forma combined financial information using the acquisition method of accounting under\nexisting U.S. GAAP standards. </p> <p>The authoritative guidance for fair value defines the term “fair value,” sets forth the valuation requirements\nfor any asset or liability measured at fair value, expands related disclosure requirements and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value is defined in the guidance\nas “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” This is an exit price concept for the valuation of the asset or\nliability. In addition, market participants are assumed to be buyers and sellers in the principal (or the most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. Fair value measurements for an asset assume the highest and best use by these market\nparticipants. Many of these fair value measurements can be highly subjective and it is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated\namounts. </p> <p>The pro forma adjustments described below have been developed based on assumptions and estimates, including assumptions relating to the\nconsideration paid and the allocation thereof to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Grand St. and ALM based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The final purchase price and the allocation thereof may differ from that reflected in\nthe pro forma combined financial statements after final valuation procedures are performed and amounts are finalized. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent\nwhat the actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations. </p>\n<p>The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructurings that\ncould result from the acquisition, as such costs are not currently factually supportable. </p>\n  <p>F-98 </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm#toc\" target=\"_blank\">Table of Contents</a></h5>\n\n <p>Management performed a review of Grand St.’s and ALM’s accounting policies, based primarily on\navailable historical financial information, to determine whether any adjustments were necessary to ensure comparability in the pro forma combined financial statements. At this time, the Company is not aware of any differences, other than those\nstated in either in the unaudited pro forma adjustments or identified in the Grand St. or ALM stand-alone financial statements provided elsewhere in this prospectus, which would have a material impact on the pro forma combined financial statements.\n</p> <p><b>Note 2—Purchase Price Allocation </b></p> <p>This\nbusiness combinations resulted in the total purchase price being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to their estimated fair values at the date of acquisitions with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as\ngoodwill as follows: </p> <p><b>Grand St.</b> (in thousands)<b> </b></p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\n\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<td width=\"89%\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"4%\"></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Cash paid</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">1,040&nbsp;</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Common shares</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">2,202&nbsp;</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"> </td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"> </td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Total purchase consideration</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">3,242&nbsp;</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"> </td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"> </td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Working capital</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">85&nbsp;</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Developed technology</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">2,000&nbsp;</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Customer relationships</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">600&nbsp;</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Trademarks</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">200&nbsp;</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Goodwill</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">991&nbsp;</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Deferred tax liability</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">(634)</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"> </td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"> </td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"> <p>Net assets acquired</p></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;$</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,242&nbsp;</td>\n<td nowrap=\"\" valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"> </td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\"> </td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n</tbody></table> <p>Included in working capital is approximately $0.1 million of cash acquired. </p>\n<p>The amounts allocated to developed technology, customer relationships and trademark (the acquired intangible assets) total $2.8 million. The fair value\nassigned to developed technology was determined primarily using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair value of Grand St.’s customer\nrelationships was determined primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management.

WTF does that mean?</p><p>(This is related to but different than <a href=\"http://www.startuplawblog.com/2011/06/29/single-trigger-acceleration/\" target=\"_blank\">single-trigger and double-trigger acceleration</a>, which you may have read about. I’m not covering those here. See <a href=\"http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-vesting/\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Wilson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.feld.com/archives/2005/05/term-sheet-vesting.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Feld</a> for primers on vesting.)</p><h2><b>Your Startup Succeeds</b></h2><p>Let’s say you’re an early employee at a startup and you get a grant for options representing 1% of the company with 4 year vesting. Two years after you accept this offer, the company gets acquired for tens of millions of dollars without taking any new funding. This is great! You can exercise your options for a tiny amount, and they are worth a lot.<br></p><p>Since you’ve been there for 2 years, half of your options are vested. No one can take those away from you. But what happens to the other half?</p><p>The acquirer—your new boss—comes to you and says that the remaining half of your options are gone. If you want to keep your job, you have to sign a new equity agreement which won’t make you nearly as much money and comes with a new 4 year vesting schedule that starts today. Can they do that?</p><p>Maybe.</p><h2><b>Your company’s option plan</b></h2><p>The answer depends on your company’s option plan—most often called an equity incentive plan. Your company has one of these to govern all options granted to employees. If you don’t have a copy, get one from whoever handles HR at your company.<br></p><p>Here’s what you’re looking for. From Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalist/dp/1118443616\" target=\"_blank\">Venture Deals</a> in the section “Assumption of Options”: “Most contemporary option plans have provisions whereby all granted options fully vest immediately prior to an acquisition should the plan and/or options underneath the plan not be assumed by the buyer.” An example of what this provision looks like is at the bottom of this post.</p><p>This standard provision is good for you. It means that the acquirer has a few options: (1) keep your same option agreement in place—same exercise price, same number of shares, same vesting, (2) replace your option agreement using the acquirer’s stock in a way that is no worse to you in terms of total payout and vesting schedule, or (3) let you exercise all your vested and unvested options now.</p><p>In short, you’ll be in at least as good a position after the acquisition as you were before it. (But note this doesn’t mean everything will be perfect. If the acquirer decides that you are no longer needed, they could keep your option agreement intact and terminate your employment. You wouldn’t get any further vesting unless you have single-trigger or double-trigger acceleration, and you’d be out of a job. It would be the same as if you’d been fired by your company before the acquisition.)<br></p><h2><b>Times are changing</b></h2><p>The problem is that some acquirers and investors are trying to change this. They want option plans to say that there is no vesting acceleration regardless of whether the acquirer assumes the option plan. This means that the acquirer can simply cancel any unvested options and offer you whatever equity compensation they want.<br></p><p>A few Bay Area serial acquirers are pushing for this. It allows them to structure retention packages for their new employees in any way they see fit. Some investors also like it because cancelled options mean they get more of the payout. (To be fair, all shareholders including founders get more of the payout.)</p><p>PERSONAL OPINION ALERT: This new trend is BS. Employee and company agreed to a deal. That deal is being pulled away by the acquirer in a way that the employee probably never knew possible. Most employees have never even seen their option plan. As a founder, I’d feel incredibly sleazy about having this type of landmine hidden away in the option plan. By keeping to the standard option plan language, acquirers have a much harder time forcing bad deals down their new employees’ throats.</p><p>The situation that is most likely to lead to problems is if the acquirer wants to keep an employee but at reduced equity compensation. Full acceleration means the acquirer can’t force a much less lucrative deal on the employee by saying they’ll be out of a job if they don’t accept the new deal. It instead forces the acquirer to honor the existing option agreement if they believe the employee is valuable. It changes the starting point of the negotiation between employee and their new boss.<br></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p>Your option plan should give you full acceleration if an acquirer does not assume the company’s option plan (or replace it with an equivalent plan). If you don’t have that, it is worth thinking through how it could be used against you. This is especially true if you are likely to have a lot of unvested options when your company gets acquired.<br></p><p><i>Sample provision regarding assumption of option plan</i>.&nbsp;This is a long, complicated provision. The bolded language in the second paragraph is the key.</p><blockquote><b>Merger or Change in Control</b>. &nbsp;In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be treated as the Administrator determines (subject to the provisions of the following paragraph) without a Participant’s consent, including, without limitation, that (i) Awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent Awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; (ii) upon written notice to a Participant, that the Participant’s Awards will terminate upon or immediately prior to the consummation of such merger or Change in Control; (iii) outstanding Awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable, or payable, or restrictions applicable to an Award will lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon consummation of such merger or Change in Control, and, to the extent the Administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such merger or Change in Control; (iv) (A) the termination of an Award in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the Administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment), or (B) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion; or (v) any combination of the foregoing. &nbsp;In taking any of the actions permitted under this subsection 13(c), the Administrator will not be obligated to treat all Awards, all Awards held by a Participant, or all Awards of the same type, similarly.<p><b>In the event that the successor corporation does not assume or substitute for the Award (or portion thereof), the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units will lapse, and, with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met.</b> &nbsp;In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.</p><p>For the purposes of this subsection 13(c), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, for each Share subject to such Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control.</p><p>Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant’s consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation’s post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.</p></blockquote>\n                  \n                \n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              </div>\n\n            </div>",

    "author": "Darrell Etherington",
    "body": "<div><div>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/20141015-086a4712-edit-edit-valour-bl-splash.jpg?w=738\">\n<p>Smartbike startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://vanhawks.com\">Vanhawks</a>, part of the Y Combinator Winter 2015 class, has raised $1.6 million from Real Ventures, Olympic triathlon gold medallist Simon Whitfield, Brenda Irwin of Relentless Pursuit partners and various angels. The company will use the funding to help deliver its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/01/vanhawks-valour/\" target=\"_blank\">Valour smartbike</a>, which raised over $820,000 on Kickstarter last year, to its first customers starting this spring. The funding will help the startup overcome some of the challenges it encountered going from concept to full production in Taiwan, and set the company up for future growth plans, which include becoming category leaders in bike-based software.</p>\n<p>Vanhawks co-founder Ali Zahid explained in an interview that the startup wasn’t surprised that it needed more&nbsp;funds to start shipping over and above what it raised on Kickstarter, since they were first-time entrepreneurs and didn’t know exactly what to expect when it came time for actual production and manufacturing. Despite missing their initial launch target of late last year for shipping the first Valour bikes out to Kickstarter backers, Zahid says they’re pleased with how things are going now and will start shipping in batches of 25 to 50 bikes at a time this spring, with the intent of working through the backlog by this summer and then offering two- to three-week delivery times on new orders. The funding also helps with the company’s long-term strategy, which extends beyond making bikes.</p>\n<p>“The vision is a lot bigger than just making bikes,” Zahid explains. “Think of us as the software layer for the bike industry of the future. Everyone says that software is eating the world, and we see that in the bike industry, too, which has&nbsp;been sitting in the past.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/20141015-086a4644-edit-valour-bl-splash.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=682\" alt=\"20141015-086A4644-Edit-Valour-bl-splash\" width=\"1024\"></p>\n<p>Zahid thinks this is the right time for someone (ideally Vanhawks) to emerge as the connected pioneer for the biking industry, which he expects to explode in the coming years. He points out that in Europe and elsewhere in the world, bikes are an incredibly popular mode of transportation, and he expects that adoption of bikes in North America will grow to match. Biking among city-dwellers has been on the rise in North America among commuters, especially <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.utrc2.org/sites/default/files/pubs/bike-renaissance-journal_0.pdf\">between 1990 and 2011</a>, so in urban centers at least Vanhawks has a growing user base to target.</p>\n<p>The Valour will showcase what Vanhawks’ software can offer bikes in terms of software, showcasing built-in turn-by-turn and blind spot detection, as well as speed tracking, road condition reports, distance and elevation, all of which helps serve a Waze-like crowdsourced route planning service for fellow bike commuters. The software also enables anti-theft tracking measures, which helps to alleviate a primary concern especially among riders who invest considerable money, time and effort into their bicycles.</p>\n<p>I like biking, and while part of the reason I like it is because it requires my full attention and essentially ensures that I can’t be glued to some kind of data feed, I see plenty of opportunity for passive data gathering that can better equip a future of connected two-wheel commuters. The Valour is cool, but long-term, as with most tech startups, the data will probably be the bigger&nbsp;story here.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>",

That’s the way it has been since the 1960s, and no amount of NoSQL has changed that. However, most self-respecting developers have got rid of mutable global variables in their code long ago. So why do we tolerate databases as they are?</i></p>\n<p><i>A more promising model, used in some systems, is to think of a database as an always-growing collection of immutable facts. You can query it at some point in time — but that’s still old, imperative style thinking. A more fruitful approach is to take the streams of facts as they come in, and functionally process them in real-time.</i></p>\n<p><i>This talk introduces Apache Samza, a distributed stream processing framework developed at LinkedIn.

Simpler code, better scalability, better robustness, lower latency, and more flexibility for doing interesting things with data. After this talk, you’ll see the architecture of your own applications in a new light.</i></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-01.png?w=660&amp;h=436\" alt=\"Turning the database inside-out with Apache Samza\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>This talk is about database architecture and application architecture. It’s somewhat related to an open source project I’ve been working on, called <a href=\"http://samza.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Samza</a>. I’m <a href=\"http://martin.kleppmann.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Kleppmann</a>, and I was until recently at LinkedIn working on Samza. At the moment I’m taking a sabbatical to write a book for O’Reilly, called <a href=\"http://dataintensive.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about databases. What I mean is not any particular brand of database — I don’t mind whether you’re using relational, or NoSQL, or whatever. I’m really talking about the general concept of a database, as we use it when building applications.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, the stereotypical web application architecture:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-02.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Three-tier architecture: client, backend, database\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>You have a client, which may be a web browser or a mobile app, and that client talks to some kind of server-side system (which you may call a “backend” or whatever you like). The backend typically implements some kind of business logic, performs access control, accepts input, produces output. When the backend needs to remember something for the future, it stores that data in a database, and when it needs to look something up, it queries a database. That’s all very familiar stuff.</p>\n<p>The way we typically build these sorts of applications is that we make the backend layer <i>stateless</i>. That has a lot of advantages: you can scale out the backend by just running more processes in parallel, and you can route any request to any backend instance (they are all equally well qualified to handle the request), so it’s easy to spread the load across multiple machines. Any state that is required to handle a request will be looked up from the database on each request. That also works nicely with HTTP, since HTTP is a stateless protocol.</p>\n<p>However, the big problem with this approach is: the state has to go <i>somewhere</i>, and so we have to put it in the database. We are now using the database as a kind of gigantic, global, shared, mutable state. It’s like a global variable that’s shared between all your application servers. It’s exactly the kind of horrendous thing that, in shared-memory concurrency, we’ve been trying to get rid of for ages. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model\" target=\"_blank\">Actors</a>, <a href=\"http://clojure.com/blog/2013/06/28/clojure-core-async-channels.html\" target=\"_blank\">channels</a>, <a href=\"https://gobyexample.com/goroutines\" target=\"_blank\">goroutines</a>, etc. are all attempts to get away from shared-memory concurrency, avoiding the problems of locking, deadlock, concurrent modifications, race conditions, and so on.</p>\n<p>We’re trying to get away from shared-memory concurrency, but with databases we’re still stuck with this big, shared, mutable state. So it’s worth thinking about this: if we’re trying to get rid of shared memory in our single-process application architecture, what would happen if we tried to get rid of this shared mutable state on a whole-system level?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-03.png?w=660&amp;h=243\" alt=\"It's always been that way\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>At the moment, it seems to me that the main reason why systems are still being built with mutable databases is just inertia: that’s the way we’ve building applications for decades, and we don’t really have good tools to do it differently. So, let’s think about what other possibilities we have for building stateful systems.</p>\n<p>In order to try to figure out what routes we could take, I’d like to look at four different examples of things that databases currently do, and things that we do with databases. And these four examples might give us an indicator of the directions in which we could take these systems forward in future.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-04.png?w=660&amp;h=206\" alt=\"Title: 1. Replication\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>The first example I’d like to look at is <i>replication</i>. You probably know about the basics of replication: the idea is that you have a copy of the same data on multiple machines (nodes), so that you can serve reads in parallel, and so that the system keeps running if you lose a machine.</p>\n<p>It’s the database’s job to keep those replicas in sync. A common architecture for replication is that you send your writes to one designated node (which you may call the <i>leader</i>, <i>master</i> or <i>primary</i>), and it’s the leader’s responsibility to ensure that the writes are copied to the other nodes (which you may call <i>followers</i>, <i>slaves</i> or <i>standbys</i>). There are also other ways of doing it, but leader-based replication is familiar — many systems are built that way.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at an example of replication to see what’s actually happening under the hood. Take a shopping cart, for instance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-05.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Shopping cart example\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>This is using a relational data model, but the same principles apply with other data models too. Say you have a table with three columns: customers, products, and quantity. Each row indicates that a particular customer has a particular quantity of a particular product in their shopping cart.</p>\n<p>Now say customer 123 changes their mind, and instead of wanting quantity 1 of product 999, they actually want quantity 3 of that product. So they issue an <i>update</i> query to the database, which matches the row for customer 123 and product 999, and it changes the value of the quantity column from 1 to 3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-06.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Updating quantity of item in the shopping cart\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>The result is that the database overwrites the quantity value with the new value, i.e. it applies the update in the appropriate place.</p>\n<p>Now, I was talking about replication. What does this update do in the context of replication? Well, first of all, you send this update query to your leader, and it executes the query, figures out which rows match the condition, and applies the write locally:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-07.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Replicating a write from a leader to a follower\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>Now, how does this write get applied to the other replicas? There are several different ways how you can implement replication. One option is to send the same update query to the follower, and it executes the same statement on its own copy of the database. Another option is to ship the write-ahead log from the leader to the follower.</p>\n<p>A third option for replication, which I’ll focus on here, is called a <i>logical log</i>. In this case, the leader writes out the effect that the query had — i.e. which rows were inserted, updated or deleted —&nbsp;like a kind of diff. For an update, like in this example, the logical log identifies the row that was changed (using a primary key or some kind of internal tuple identifier), gives the new value of that row, and perhaps also the old value.</p>\n<p>This might seem like nothing special, but notice that something interesting has happened here:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-08.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Update statement is imperative, replication event is immutable\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>At the top we have the update statement, an imperative statement describing the state mutation. It is an instruction to the database, telling it to modify certain rows in the database that match certain conditions.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, when the write is replicated from the leader to the follower as part of the logical log, it takes a different form: it becomes an event, stating that at a particular point in time, a particular customer changed the quantity of a particular product in their cart from 1 to 3. And this is a <i>fact</i> — even if the customer later removes the item from their cart, or changes the quantity again, or goes away and never comes back, that doesn’t change the fact that this state change occurred. The fact always remains true.</p>\n<p>This distinction between an imperative modification and an immutable fact is something you may have seen in the context of <a href=\"http://blog.confluent.io/2015/01/29/making-sense-of-stream-processing/\" target=\"_blank\">event sourcing</a>. That’s a method of database design that says you should structure all of your data as immutable facts, and it’s an interesting idea.</p>\n<p>However, what I’m saying here is: even if you use your database in the traditional way, overwriting old state with new state, the database’s internal replication mechanism may still be translating those imperative statements into a stream of immutable events.</p>\n<p>Hold that thought for now: I’m going to talk about some completely different things, and return to this idea later.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-09.png?w=660&amp;h=363\" alt=\"Title: 2. Secondary indexes\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>The second one of the four things I want to talk about is <i>secondary indexing</i>. You’re probably familiar with secondary indexes —&nbsp;they are the bread and butter of relational databases. Using the shopping cart example again:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-10.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Two indexes on one table\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>You have a table with different columns, and you may have several different indexes on that table in order to be able to efficiently find rows that match a particular query. For example, you may run some SQL to create two indexes: one on the customer_id column, and a separate index on the product_id column.</p>\n<p>Using the index on customer_id you can then efficiently find all the items that a particular customer has in their cart. Using the index on product_id you can efficiently find all the carts that contain a particular product.</p>\n<p>What does the database do when you run one of these CREATE INDEX queries?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-11.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"An index is a data structure derived from table data\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>The database scans over the entire table, and it creates an auxiliary data structure for each index. An index is a data structure that represents the information in the base table in some different way. In this case, the index is a key-value-like structure: the keys are the contents of the column that you’re indexing, and the values are the rows that contain this particular key.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-12.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Values in table cells become keys in the index\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>Put another way: to build the index for the customer_id column, the database takes all the values that appear in that column, and uses them as keys in a dictionary. A value points at all of the occurrences of that value — for example, the index entry 123 points at all of the rows which have a customer_id of 123. Similarly for the other index.</p>\n<p>The important point here is that the process of going from the base table to the indexes is completely mechanical. You simply tell the database that you want a particular index to exist, and it goes away and builds that index for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-13.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Index is generated from table through a derivation function\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>The index doesn’t add any new information to the database — it just represents the existing data in a different structure. (Put another way, if you drop the index, that doesn’t delete any data from your database.) It’s a redundant data structure that only exists to make certain queries faster. And that data structure can be entirely <i>derived</i> from the original table.</p>\n<p>Creating an index is essentially a transformation which takes a database table as input, and produces an index as output. The transformation consists of going through all the rows in the table, picking out the field that you want to index, and restructuring the data so that you can look up by that field. That transformation is built into the database, so you don’t need to implement it yourself. You just tell the database that you want an index on a particular field to exist, and it does all the work of building it.</p>\n<p>Another great thing about indexes: whenever the data in the underlying table changes, the database automatically updates the indexes to be consistent with the new data in the table. In other words, this transformation function which derives the index from the original table is not just applied once when you create the index, but applied continuously.</p>\n<p>With many databases, these index updates are even done in a transactionally consistent way. This means that any later transactions will see the data in the index in the same state as it is in the underlying table. If a transaction aborts and rolls back, the index modifications are also rolled back. That’s a really great feature which we often don’t appreciate!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-14.png?w=660&amp;h=434\" alt=\"Create index concurrently\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>What’s even better is that some databases let you build an index at the same time as continuing to process write queries. In PostgreSQL, for example, you can say <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-createindex.html#SQL-CREATEINDEX-CONCURRENTLY\" target=\"_blank\">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</a>. On a large table, creating an index could take several hours, and on a production database you wouldn’t want to have to stop writing to the table while the index is being built. The index builder really needs to be a background process which can run while your application is simultaneously reading and writing to the database as usual.</p>\n<p>The fact that databases can do this is quite impressive. After all, to build an index, the database has to scan the entire table contents, but those contents are changing at the same time as the scan is happening. The index builder is tracking a moving target. At the end, the database ends up with a transactionally consistent index, despite the fact that the data was changing concurrently.</p>\n<p>In order to do this, the database needs to build the index from a consistent snapshot at one point in time, and also keep track of all the changes that occurred since that snapshot while the index build was in progress. That’s a really cool feature.</p>\n<p>So far we’ve discussed two aspects of databases: replication and secondary indexing. Let’s move on to number 3: caching.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-15.png?w=660&amp;h=233\" alt=\"Title: 3. Caching\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>What I’m talking about here is caching that is explicitly done by the application. (You also get caching happening automatically at various levels, such as the operating system’s page cache and the CPU caches, but that’s not what I’m talking about here.)</p>\n<p>Say you have a website that becomes popular, and it becomes too expensive or too slow to hit the database for every web request, so you introduce a caching layer — often using <a href=\"http://memcached.org/\" target=\"_blank\">memcached</a> or <a href=\"http://redis.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Redis</a> or something of that sort. And often this cache is managed in application code, which typically looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-16.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Reading from a cache; filling cache from DB on miss\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>When a request arrives at the application, you first look in a cache to see whether the data you want is already there. The cache lookup is typically by some key that describes the data you want. If the data is in the cache, you can return it straight to the client.</p>\n<p>If the data you want isn’t in the cache, that’s a cache miss. You then go to the underlying database, and query the data that you want. On the way out, the application also writes that data to the cache, so that it’s there for the next request that needs it. The thing it writes to the cache is whatever the application would have wanted to see there in the first place. Then the application returns the data to the client.</p>\n<p>This is a very common pattern, but there are several big problems with it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-17.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Problems with read-through caching\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>The first problem is that clichéd quote about there being only <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\" target=\"_blank\">two hard problems in computer science</a> (which I can’t stand any more). But seriously, if you’re managing a cache like this, then cache invalidation really is tricky. When data in the underlying database changes, how do you know what entries in the cache to expire or update? One option is to have an expiry algorithm which figures out which database change affects which cache entries, but those algorithms are brittle and error-prone. Alternatively, you can just have a time-to-live (expiry time) and accept that you sometimes read stale data from the cache, but such staleness is often unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Another problem is that this architecture is very prone to race conditions. For example, say you have two processes concurrently writing to the database and also updating the cache. They might update the database in one order, and the cache in the other order, and now the two are inconsistent. Or if you fill the cache on read, you may read and write concurrently, and so the cache is updated with a stale value while the concurrent write is occurring. I suspect that most of us building these systems just pretend that the race conditions don’t exist, because they are just too much to think about.</p>\n<p>A third problem is cold start. If you reboot your memcached servers and they lose all their cached contents, suddenly every request is a cache miss, the database is overloaded because of the sudden surge in requests, and you’re in a world of pain. If you want to create a new cache, you need some way of bootstrapping its contents without overloading other parts of the system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-18.png?w=660&amp;h=433\" alt=\"Creating an index is simple, maintaining a cache is a mess\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>So, here we have a contrast: on the one hand, creating a secondary index in a database is beautifully simple, one line of SQL —&nbsp;the database handles it automatically, keeping everything up-to-date, and even making the index transactionally consistent. On the other hand, application-level cache maintenance is a complete mess of complicated invalidation logic, race conditions and operational problems.</p>\n<p>Why should it be that way? Secondary indexes and caches are not fundamentally different. We said earlier that a secondary index is just a redundant data structure on the side, which structures the same data in a different way, in order to speed up read queries. A cache is just the same.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-19.png?w=660&amp;h=388\" alt=\"But a cache is also generated from a database through a derivation function\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>If you think about it, a cache is also the result of taking your data in one form (the form in which it’s stored in the database) and transforming it into a different form for faster reads. In other words, the contents of the cache are derived from the contents of the database.</p>\n<p>We said that a secondary index is built by picking out one field from every record, and using that as the key in a dictionary. In the case of a cache, we may apply an arbitrary function to the data: the data from the database may have gone through some kind of business logic or rendering before it’s put in the cache, and it may be the result of joining several records from different tables. But the end result is similar: if you lose your cache, you can rebuild it from the underlying database; thus, the contents of the cache are derived from the database.</p>\n<p>In a read-through cache, this transformation happens on the fly, when there is a cache miss. But we could perhaps imagine making the process of building and updating a cache more systematic, and more similar to secondary indexes. Let’s return to that idea later.</p>\n<p>I said I was going to talk about four different aspects of database. Let’s move on to the fourth: <i>materialized views</i>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-20.png?w=660&amp;h=376\" alt=\"Title 4. Materialized views\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>You may already know what materialized views are, but let me explain them briefly in case you’ve not previously come across them. You may be more familiar with “normal” views — non-materialized views, or virtual views, or whatever you want to call them. They work like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-21.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"How a normal (non-materialized) view works\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>In a relational database, where views are common, you would create a view by saying “CREATE VIEW viewname…” followed by a SELECT query. When you now look at this view in the database, it looks somewhat like a table —&nbsp;you can use it in read queries like any other table. And when you do this, say you SELECT * from that view, the database’s query planner actually rewrites the query into the underlying query that you used in the definition of the view.</p>\n<p>So you can think of a view as a kind of convenient alias, a wrapper that allows you to create an abstraction, hiding a complicated query behind a simpler interface.</p>\n<p>Contrast that with a <i>materialized</i> view, which is defined using almost identical syntax:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-22.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Creating a materialized views: copy of data\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>You also define a materialized view in terms of a SELECT query; the only syntactic difference is that you say CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW instead of CREATE VIEW. However, the implementation is totally different.</p>\n<p>When you create a materialized view, the database starts with the underlying tables — that is, the tables you’re querying in the SELECT statement of the view (“bar” in the example). The database scans over the entire contents of those tables, executes that SELECT query on all of the data, and copies the results of that query into something like a temporary table.</p>\n<p>The results of this query are actually written to disk, in a form that’s very similar to a a normal table. And that’s really what “materialized” means in this context: it just means that the view’s query has been executed and the results written to disk.</p>\n<p>Remember that with the non-materialized view, the database would expand the view into the underlying query at query time. On the other hand, when you query a materialized view, the database can read its contents directly from disk, just like a table. The view’s underlying query has already been executed ahead of time, so the database now just needs to read the result. This is especially useful if the view’s underlying query is expensive.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-23.png?w=660&amp;h=379\" alt=\"Derivation function for materialized view\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>If you’re thinking “this seems like a cache of query results”, you would be right — that’s exactly what it is. However, the big difference between a materialized view and application-managed caches is the responsibility for keeping it up-to-date.</p>\n<p>With a materialized view, you declare once how you want the materialized view to be defined, and the database takes care of building that view from a consistent snapshot of the underlying tables (much like building a secondary index). Moreover, when the data in the underlying tables changes, the database takes responsibility for maintaining the materialized view, keeping it up-to-date. Some databases do this materialized view maintenance on an ongoing basis, and some require you to periodically refresh the view so that changes take effect. But you certainly don’t have to do cache invalidation in your application code.</p>\n<p>Another feature of application-managed caches is that you can apply arbitrary business logic to the data before storing it in the cache, so that you can do less work at query time, or reduce the amount of data you need to cache. Could a materialized view do something similar?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-24.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Use JavaScript stored procedure in derivation function\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>In a relational database, materialized views are defined using SQL, so the transformations they can apply to the data are limited to the operations that are built into SQL (which are very restricted compared to a general-purpose programming language). However, many databases can also be extended using stored procedures — code that runs inside the database and can be called from SQL. For example, you can <a href=\"http://pgxn.org/dist/plv8/\" target=\"_blank\">use JavaScript</a> to write PostgreSQL stored procedures. This would let you implement something like an application-level cache, including arbitrary business logic, running as a materialized view inside a database.</p>\n<p>I am not convinced that this is necessarily a good idea: with code running inside your database, it’s much harder to reason about monitoring, versioning, deployments, performance impact, multi-tenant resource isolation, and so on. I don’t think I would advocate stored procedures as an application development platform. However, the idea of materialized views is nevertheless interesting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-25.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Comparison of replication, secondary indexing, caching and materialized views\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>Let’s recap the four aspects of databases that we discussed: replication, secondary indexing, caching, and materialized views. What they all have in common is that they are dealing with <i>derived data</i> in some way: some secondary data structure is derived from an underlying, primary dataset, via a transformation process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We first discussed replication, i.e. keeping a copy of the same data on multiple machines. It generally works very well, so we’ll give it a green smiley. There are some operational quirks with some databases, and some of the tooling is a bit weird, but on the whole it’s mature, well-understood, and well-supported.</li>\n<li>Similarly, secondary indexing works very well. You can build a secondary index concurrently with processing write queries, and the database somehow manages to do this in a transactionally consistent way.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, application-level caching is a complete mess. Red frowny face.</li>\n<li>And materialized views are so-so: the idea is good, but the way they’re implemented is not what you’d want from a modern application development platform. Maintaining the materialized view puts additional load on the database, while actually the whole point of a cache is to <i>reduce</i> load on the database!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-26.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Magically self-updating cache...\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>However, there’s something really compelling about this idea of materialized views. I see a materialized view almost as a kind of cache that magically keeps itself up-to-date. Instead of putting all of the complexity of cache invalidation in the application (risking race conditions and all the discussed problems), materialized views say that cache maintenance should be the responsibility of the data infrastructure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-27.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Let's rethink materialized views!\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>So let’s think about this: can we reinvent materialized views, implement them in a modern and scalable way, and use them as a general mechanism for cache maintenance?</p>\n<p>If we started with a clean slate, without the historical baggage of existing databases, what would the ideal architecture for applications look like?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-28.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Traditionally, the replication stream is an implementation detail\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>Think back to leader-based replication which we discussed earlier. You make your writes to a leader, which first applies the writes locally, and then sends those writes over the network to follower nodes. In other words, the leader sends a stream of data changes to the followers. We discussed a logical log as one way of implementing this.</p>\n<p>In a traditional database architecture, application developers are not supposed to think about that replication stream. It’s an implementation detail that is hidden by the database abstraction. SQL queries and responses are the database’s public interface —&nbsp;and the replication stream is not part of the public interface. You’re not supposed to go and parse that stream, and use it for your own purposes. (Yes, there are <a href=\"http://tungsten-replicator.org/\" target=\"_blank\">tools that do this</a>, but in traditional databases they are on the periphery of what is supported, whereas the SQL interface is the dominant access method.)</p>\n<p>And in some ways this is reasonable —&nbsp;the relational model is a pretty good abstraction, which is why it has been so popular for several decades. But SQL is not the last word in databases.</p>\n<p>What if we took that replication stream, and made it a first-class citizen in our data architecture? What if we changed our infrastructure so that the replication stream was not an implementation detail, but a key part of the public interface of the database? What if we <i>turn the database inside out</i>, take the implementation detail that was previously hidden, and make it a top-level concern? What would that look like?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-29.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Unbundle the database: make the transaction log a first-class component\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>Well, you could call that replication stream a <i>“transaction log”</i> or an <i>“event stream”</i>. You can format all your writes as immutable events (facts), like we saw earlier in the context of a logical log. Now each write is just an immutable event that you can append to the end of the transaction log. The transaction log is a really simple, append-only data structure.</p>\n<p>There are various ways of implementing this, but one good choice for the transaction log is to use <a href=\"http://kafka.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Kafka</a>. It provides an append-only log data structure, but it does so in a reliable and scalable manner — it durably writes everything to disk, it replicates data across multiple machines (so that you don’t lose any data if you lose a machine), and it partitions the stream across multiple machines for horizontal scalability. It easily handles <a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/benchmarking-apache-kafka-2-million-writes-second-three-cheap-machines\" target=\"_blank\">millions of writes</a> per second on very modest hardware.</p>\n<p>When you do this, you don’t need to necessarily make your writes through a leader database — you could also imagine directly appending your writes to the log. (Going through a leader would still be useful if you want to validate that writes meet certain constraints before writing them to the log.)</p>\n<p>Writing to this system is now super fast and scalable, because the only thing you’re doing is appending an event to a log. But what about reads? Reading data that has been written to the log is now really inconvenient, because you have to scan the entire log to find the thing that you want.</p>\n<p>The solution is to build materialized views from the writes in the transaction log. The materialized views are just like the secondary indexes we talked about earlier: data structures that are derived from the data in the log, and optimized for fast reading. A materialized view is just a <a href=\"http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">cached subset of the log</a>, and you could rebuild it from the log at any time. There could be many different materialized views onto the same data: a key-value store, a full-text search index, a graph index, an analytics system, and so on.</p>\n<p>You can think of this as <i>“unbundling”</i> the database. All the stuff that was previously packed into a single monolithic software package is being broken out into modular components that can be composed in flexible ways.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-30.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Derive materialized views from the transaction log using Samza\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>If you use Kafka to implement the log, how do you implement these materialized views? That’s where <a href=\"http://samza.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Samza</a> comes in. It’s a stream processing framework that is designed to go well with Kafka. With Samza, you write jobs that consume the events in a log, and build cached views of the data in the log. When a job first starts up, it can build up its state by consuming all the events in the log. And on an ongoing basis, whenever a new event appears in the stream, it can update the view accordingly. The view can be any existing database or index —&nbsp;Samza just provides the framework for processing the stream.</p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to read data can now query those materialized views that are maintained by the Samza jobs. Those views are just databases, indexes or caches, and you can send read-only requests to them in the usual way. The difference to traditional database architecture is that if you want to write to the system, you don’t write directly to the same databases that you read from. Instead, you write to the log, and there is an explicit transformation process which takes the data on the log and applies it to the materialized views.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-31.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Make writes an append-only stream of immutable facts\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>This separation of reads and writes is really the key idea here. By putting writes only in the log, we can make them much simpler: we don’t need to update state in place, so we move away from the problems of concurrent mutation of global shared state. Instead, we just keep an append-only log of immutable events. This gives excellent performance (appending to a file is sequential I/O, which is much faster than random-access I/O), is easily scalable (independent events can be put in separate partitions), and is much easier to make reliable.</p>\n<p>If it’s too expensive for you to keep the entire history of every change that ever happened to your data, Kafka supports compaction, which is a kind of garbage collection process that runs in the background. It’s very similar to the log compaction that databases do internally. But that doesn’t change the basic principle of working with streams of immutable events.</p>\n<p>These ideas are nothing new. To mention just a few examples, <a href=\"http://blog.confluent.io/2015/01/29/making-sense-of-stream-processing/\" target=\"_blank\">Event Sourcing</a> is a data modelling technique based on the same principle; query languages like <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Letizia_Tanca/publication/3296132_What_…_about_Datalog_(and_never_dared_toask)/links/0fcfd50ca2d20473ca000000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Datalog</a> have been based on immutable facts for decades; databases like <a href=\"http://www.datomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Datomic</a> are built on immutability, enabling neat features like point-in-time historical queries; and the <a href=\"http://manning.com/marz/\" target=\"_blank\">Lambda Architecture</a> is one possible approach for dealing with immutable datasets at scale. At many levels of the stack, immutability is being <a href=\"http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">applied successfully</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-32.png?w=660&amp;h=413\" alt=\"Make reads from materialized views\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>On the read side, we need to start thinking less about querying databases, and more about consuming and joining streams, and maintaining materialized views of the data in the form in which we want to read it.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I think querying databases will continue to be important: for example, when an analyst is running exploratory ad-hoc queries against a data warehouse of historical data, it doesn’t make much sense to use materialized views — for those kinds of queries it’s better to just keep all the raw events, and to build databases which can scan over them very quickly. Modern column stores have become very good at that.</p>\n<p>But in situations where you might use application-managed caches (namely, an OLTP context where the queries are known in advance and predictable), materialized views are very helpful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-33.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Precompute and maintain materialized views from the log\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>There are a few differences between a read-through cache (which gets invalidated or updated within the application code) and a materialized view (which is maintained by consuming a log):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With the materialized view, there is a principled <i>translation process</i> from the write-optimized data in the log into the read-optimized data in the view. That translation runs in a separate process which you can monitor, debug, scale and maintain independently from the rest of your application. By contrast, in the typical read-through caching approach, the cache management logic is deeply intertwined with the rest of the application, it’s easy to introduce bugs, and it’s difficult to understand what is happening.</li>\n<li>A cache is filled on demand when there is a cache miss (so the first request for a given object is always slow). By contrast, a materialized view is <i>precomputed</i>, i.e. its entire contents are computed before anyone asks for it — just like a secondary index. This means there is no such thing as a cache miss: if an item doesn’t exist in the materialized view, it doesn’t exist in the database. There is no need to fall back to some kind of underlying database.</li>\n<li>Once you have this process for translating logs into views, you have great flexibility to create new views: if you want to present your existing data in some new way, you can simply create a new stream processing job, consume the input log from the beginning, and thus build a completely new view onto all the existing data. (If you think about it, this is pretty much what a database does internally when you create a new secondary index on an existing table.) You can then maintain both views in parallel, gradually move applications to the new view, and eventually discard the old view. No more scary stop-the-world schema migrations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-34.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Mechanics that need to be solved for practical adoption\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>Of course, such a big change in application architecture and database architecture means that many practical details need to be figured out: how do you deploy and monitor these stream processing jobs, how do you make the system robust to various kinds of fault, how do you integrate with existing systems, and so on? But the good news is that all of these issues are being worked on. It’s a fast-moving area with lots of activity, so if you find it interesting, we’d love your contributions to the open source projects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-35.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Happiness\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>We are still figuring out how to build large-scale applications well — what techniques we can use to make our systems scalable, reliable and maintainable. Put more bluntly, we need to figure out ways to stop our applications turning into <a href=\"http://www.laputan.org/pub/foote/mud.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">big balls of mud</a>.</p>\n<p>However, to me, this approach of immutable events and materialized views seems like a very promising route forwards. I am optimistic that this kind of application architecture will help us build better (more powerful and more reliable) software faster.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-36.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Why?\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>The changes I’ve proposed are quite radical, and it’s going to be a lot of work to put them into practice. If we are going to completely change the way we use databases, we had better have some very good reasons. So let me give three reasons why I think it’s worth moving towards a log of immutable events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-37.png?w=660&amp;h=414\" alt=\"Reason 1: Better data\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>Firstly, I think that writing data as a log produces better-quality data than if you update a database directly. For example, if someone adds an item to their shopping cart and then removes it again, those actions have information value. If you delete that information from the database when a customer removes an item from the cart, you’ve just thrown away information that would have been valuable for analytics and recommendation systems.</p>\n<p>The entire long-standing debate about normalization in databases is predicated on the assumption that data is going to be written and read in the same schema. A normalized database (with no redundancy) is optimized for writing, whereas a denormalized database is optimized for reading. If you separate the writing side (the log) from the reading side (materialized views), you can denormalize the reading side to your heart’s content, but still retain the ability to process writes efficiently.</p>\n<p>Another very nice feature of an append-only log is that it allows much easier recovery from errors. If you deploy some bad code that writes incorrect data to the database, or if a human enters some incorrect data, you can look at the log to see the exact history of what happened, and <a href=\"http://nathanmarz.com/blog/how-to-beat-the-cap-theorem.html\" target=\"_blank\">undo it</a>. That kind of recovery is much harder if you’ve overwritten old data with new data, or even deleted data incorrectly. Also, any kind of audit is much easier if you only ever append to a log —&nbsp;that’s why <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pathelland/archive/2007/06/14/accountants-don-t-use-erasers.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">accountants don’t use erasers</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-38.png?w=660&amp;h=416\" alt=\"Reason 2: Fully precomputed caches\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>Secondly, we can fix all the problems of read-through caches that we discussed earlier. The cold start problem goes away, because we can simply precompute the entire contents of the cache (which also means there’s no such thing as a cache miss).</p>\n<p>If materialized views are only ever updated via the log, then a whole class of race conditions goes away: the log defines the order in which writes are applied, so all the views that are based on the same log apply the changes in the same order, so they end up being consistent with each other. The log <a href=\"http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying\" target=\"_blank\">squeezes the non-determinism</a> of concurrency out of the stream of writes.</p>\n<p>What I particularly like is that this architecture helps enable agile, incremental software development. If you want to experiment with a new product feature, for which you need to present existing data in a new way, you can just build a new view onto your data without affecting any of the existing views. You can then show that view to a subset of users, and test whether it’s better than the old thing. If yes, you can gradually move users to the new view; if not, you can just drop the view as if nothing had happened. This is much more flexible than schema migrations, which are generally an all-or-nothing affair. Being able to experiment freely with new features, without onerous migration processes, is a tremendous enabler.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-39.png?w=660&amp;h=360\" alt=\"Reason 3: Streams everywhere\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>My third reason for wanting to change database architecture is that it allows us to put streams everywhere. This point needs a bit more explanation.</p>\n<p>Imagine what happens when a user of your application views some data. In a traditional database architecture, the data is loaded from a database, perhaps transformed with some business logic, and perhaps written to a cache. Data in the cache is rendered into a user interface in some way — for example, by rendering it to HTML on the server, or by transferring it to the client as JSON and rendering it on the client.</p>\n<p>The result of template rendering is some kind of structure describing the user interface layout: in a web browser, this would be the HTML DOM, and in a native application this would be using the operating system’s UI components. Either way, a rendering engine eventually turns this description of UI components into pixels in video memory, and this is what the user actually sees.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-40.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Transformation pipeline of materialized views\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>When you look at it like this, it looks very much like a data transformation pipeline. In fact, you can think of each lower layer as a materialized view of the upper layer: the cache is a materialized view of the database (the cache contents are derived from the database contents); the HTML DOM is a materialized view of the cache (the HTML is derived from the JSON stored in the cache); and the pixels in video memory are a materialized view of the HTML DOM (the rendering engine derives the pixels from the UI layout).</p>\n<p>Now, how well does each of these transformation steps work? I would argue that web browser rendering engines are brilliant feats of engineering. You can use JavaScript to change some CSS class, or have some CSS rules conditional on mouse-over, and the rendering engine automatically figures out which rectangle of the page needs to be re-rendered as a result of the changes. It does hardware-accelerated animations and even 3D transformations. The pixels in video memory are automatically kept up-to-date with the underlying DOM state, and this very complex transformation process works remarkably well.</p>\n<p>What about the transformation from data objects to user interface components? I’ve given it a yellow “so-so” smiley for now, as the techniques for updating user interface based on data changes are still quite new. However, they are rapidly maturing: on the web, frameworks like <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook’s React</a>, <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Angular</a> and <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ember</a> are enabling user interfaces that can be updated from a stream, and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) languages like <a href=\"http://elm-lang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Elm</a> are in the same area. There is a lot of activity in this field, and it is rapidly maturing towards a green smiley.</p>\n<p>However, the transformation from database writes to cache/materialized view updates is still mostly stuck in the dark ages. That’s what this entire talk is about: database-driven backend services are currently the weakest link in this entire data transformation pipeline. Even if the user interface can dynamically update when the underlying data changes, that’s not much use if the application can’t detect when data changes!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-41.png?w=660&amp;h=495\" alt=\"Clients subscribe to materialized view changes\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>If we move to an architecture where materialized views are updated from a stream of changes, that opens up an exciting new prospect: when a client reads from one of these views, it can keep the connection open. If that view is later updated, due to some change that appeared in the stream, the server can use this connection to notify the client about the change (for example, using a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/WebSockets\" target=\"_blank\">WebSocket</a> or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events\" target=\"_blank\">Server-Sent Events</a>). The client can then update its user interface accordingly.</p>\n<p>This means that the client is not just reading the view at one point in time, but actually subscribing to the stream of changes that may subsequently happen. Provided that the client’s internet connection remains active, the server can push any changes to the client. After all, why would you ever want outdated information on your screen if more recent information is available? The notion of static web pages, which are requested once and then never change, is looking increasingly anachronistic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-42.png?w=660&amp;h=407\" alt=\"Move from request/response to subscribe/notify\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>However, allowing clients to subscribe to changes in data requires a big rethink of the way we write applications. The request-response model is very deeply engrained in our thinking, in our network protocols and in our programming languages: whether it’s a request to a RESTful service, or a method call on an object, the assumption is generally that you’re going to make one request, and get one response. There’s generally no provision for an ongoing stream of responses. Basically, I’m saying that in the future, REST is not going to cut the mustard, because it’s based on a request-response model.</p>\n<p>Instead of thinking of requests and responses, we need to start thinking of subscribing to streams and notifying subscribers of new events. And this needs to happen through all the layers of the stack — the databases, the client libraries, the application servers, the business logic, the frontends, and so on. If you want the user interface to dynamically update in response to data changes, that will only be possible if we systematically apply stream thinking everywhere, so that data changes can propagate through all the layers. I think we’re going to see a lot more people using stream-friendly programming models based on actors and channels, or <i>reactive</i> frameworks such as <a href=\"http://reactivex.io/\" target=\"_blank\">RxJava</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m glad to see that some people are already working on this. A few weeks ago RethinkDB <a href=\"http://rethinkdb.com/blog/realtime-web/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that they are going to support clients subscribing to query results, and being notified if the query results change. <a href=\"https://www.meteor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Meteor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.firebase.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Firebase</a> are also worth mentioning, as frameworks which integrate the database backend and user interface layers so as to be able to push changes into the user interface. These are excellent efforts. We need many more like them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://confluentinc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/slide-43.png?w=660&amp;h=415\" alt=\"Streams everywhere!\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>This brings us to the end of this talk. We started by observing that traditional databases and caches are like global variables, a kind of shared mutable state that becomes messy at scale. We explored four aspects of databases — replication, secondary indexing, caching and materialized views —&nbsp;which naturally led us to the idea of streams of immutable events. We then looked at how things would get better if we oriented our database architecture around streams and materialized views, and found some compelling directions for the future.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this is not science fiction —&nbsp;it’s happening now. People are working on various parts of the problem and finding good solutions. The tools at our disposal are rapidly becoming better. It’s an exciting time to be building software.</p>\n<p><i>If this excessively long article was not enough, and you want to read even more on the topic, I would recommend:</i></p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>My upcoming book, <a href=\"http://dataintensive.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>, systematically explores the architecture of data systems.

You might be able to fold it into thirds with a bit of fiddling and guessing, but what about into fifths?  Or sevenths?  Or thirteenths?   Here is a simple way you can fold a piece of paper into any fraction you would like – exactly – no guessing or fiddling needed! \n</p>\n<h3>Folding a third</h3>\n<p>\nTo start, take a square piece of paper and mark half way along top side with a small crease.

One of these is a right angle (marked with a square corner in the picture), which means that the pair of other angles (marked with the single and double lines in the picture) add to 90 degrees.  Each of the angles of this pair also form part of a right-angled triangle (the top-right and top-left  triangles), which means the other angle of the pair also appears in each of these right-angled triangles.  And the bottom-right triangle also shares an angle with the top-right triangle.  And, as it is also a right-angled triangle, it too contains the same pair of angles.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nThis all means that the three triangles are <em>similar</em> – they have the same shape.  That is to say, they all have the same angles, and so, have the same ratios of lengths of their sides.

Very early in the company’s history, in 1996, he had made the aforementioned Yahoo Japan partnership with Japanese entrepreneur Masayoshi Son of Softbank. It proved very successful. Almost a decade later, Yahoo wanted to do the same sort of thing in China. But it was failing in its original efforts.</p><p>“China turned out to be a very different place,” says Yang. “We were not doing well, struggled with acquisitions there. We were looking to parlay an operational role, where we rely on a partner, invest and be along for their ride.”</p><figure><div><img src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*CErmv4bq2-asoEicS56dGw.jpeg\"></div><figcaption>Jack Ma and Jerry Yang at Pebble Beach, 2005.</figcaption></figure><p>Yahoo’s CEO at the time, Terry Semel, and his COO, Dan Rosensweig, told Yang to pick a partner. One Chinese company in particular was beating Yahoo soundly in e-commerce — Alibaba, led by a hustling businessman named Jack Ma and his chief financial officer, Joe Tsai. “It was fairly obvious to choose,” says Yang. The deal was cooked up on the Pebble Beach golf course in 2005, with Yahoo investing $1 billion for 40 percent of Alibaba. “We were in the right place in the right time,” he says. “It was probably good that we had been failing in China.”</p><p>That’s for sure. Because over the next few years, as Yahoo’s fortunes and stock price faltered, Alibaba grew bigger and bigger. And the value of Yahoo’s stake skyrocketed. As the roles reversed, the relationship took on a “Star is Born” aspect. Alibaba naturally was unhappy that a declining enterprise owned such a huge share of its value. And Yahoo became more and more dependent on its Alibaba stock. In 2008, when Microsoft made a hostile bid for Yahoo, Yang was determined to fend it off—largely because he knew how valuable the Alibaba stock would be. “I am happy that the company had an asset, a buffer to allow its reinvention,” he says.</p><p>But in some ways the Alibaba stake became a mixed blessing, and in recent years the struggles over it have changed the cinematic analogy to “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.” Because Yahoo held such a valuable, yet undervalued asset locked within its corporate balance sheet, some investors jumped in, sensing a bargain. But they had specific ideas on what Yahoo should or should not do with the money. Those ideas generally tilted towards giving money back to shareholders like themselves; often these new investors found themselves at odds with the people trying to run Yahoo’s actual business. There were fears that they were actually plotting with Alibaba to take over Yahoo. And each subsequent Yahoo CEO would find that trying to thwart those investors was a dangerous game.</p><p>One investor came early to the realization that Yahoo’s Alibaba holdings eclipsed its actual business. He was a small stakeholder named Eric Jackson who had been a thorn in Yahoo’s side for several years: in 2007, he had led a shareholder revolt that arguably hastened the departure of then-CEO Terry Semel. In 2010, Jackson visited Hong Kong and won a rare meeting with Alibaba’s CFO, Tsai. “His ulterior motive was that he was having difficulties with Carol Bartz [who had become Yahoo’s CEO],” says Jackson. While Tsai railed against Yahoo’s refusal to sell back shares to Alibaba, Jackson was able to learn about Tsai’s company. “My eyes were as big as saucers,” he says. He realized that this Chinese company was about to become huge—and Yahoo’s holdings were way out of proportion with the value of its core business.</p><p>Jackson joined forces with a much richer player, hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb of Third Point. Loeb took a big share of Yahoo and began pushing for Yahoo to sell shares back to Alibaba and give cash back to shareholders. This synced perfectly with Jack Ma and Joe Tsai’s desires.</p><p>The CEO of Yahoo at that point was Scott Thompson. (Yes, we have moved only a few months in our narrative and there is another Yahoo CEO. Scorecards sold in the lobby.) Because Thompson was resisting a sell-off, Loeb wanted him out—and by discovering and exploiting inaccuracies in Thompson’s resume, Loeb succeeded. Thompson resigned in May 2012.</p><p>The interim CEO who took Thompson’s place, hoping to pacify Loeb and perhaps prevent a takeover, then agreed to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://investor.yahoo.net/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=707698&amp;soc_src=m…oc_trk=ma&amp;soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma&amp;soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\" rel=\"nofollow\">deal </a>that Loeb and Alibaba wanted. For Yahoo, it was a catastrophic arrangement. Yahoo would sell back 535 million shares, around half its stake, at $13 a share, for a total of around $7 billion. Had Yahoo not sold, the value of those shares would eventually have been worth $45 billion. Worse, it was a taxable transaction and almost half of Yahoo’s proceeds evaporated instantly. Eighty-five percent of the after-tax amount went to shareholders. Only the remaining crumbs went to Yahoo’s cash reserves.</p><p>That wasn’t all. The deal specified that when Alibaba went public, as was expected in a few years, Yahoo would be bound to sell 261 million more shares, half of its <em>remaining</em> stake. At that point the shares would be on a steep rise; selling at that point would violate investment wisdom. And once again, Yahoo’s proceeds would be taxable.</p><p>The deal was completed in September 2012. By then Marissa Mayer was CEO. To say her team was chagrined at the arrangement was an understatement. “Being forced to sell half our stake at the IPO was an unmitigated financial disaster,” says Jackie Reses, whom Mayer hired as Yahoo’s chief development officer.</p><p>Mayer knew how important it was for Yahoo to repair its relationship with Alibaba, which in Reses’ description “had gone down a toxic path and fractured.” Mayer appointed Reses to be Yahoo’s representative on Alibaba’s board. Reses previously had been with a private equity firm, so she had experience in high finance.</p><p>“I focused on Alibaba everyday,” says Reses. “Very few days would go by—very few <em>hours</em> would go by—where I wasn’t paying attention to what was happening to Alibaba.” She regularly flew to China, honoring the Alibaba team by seeing them on their home turf.</p></div><div><figure><div><img src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*e6k2lTX7hYpa3STzEVNmAw.png\"></div></figure></div><div><p>Alibaba went public last year, and that dreadful 2012 pact indeed required Yahoo to sell half of its stake. But because of the good relations that Mayer’s team had established with Alibaba, Yahoo was able to negotiate a smaller sell-off. When Alibaba debuted on the NYSE on September 19, 2014, Yahoo sold 140 million shares for around $9 billion. It was still a bad deal—Yahoo’s preference would have been to sell no shares at all, leaving its stake untaxed and growing in value. But the renegotiation saved Yahoo billions.</p><p>Mayer returned half of the after-tax money to shareholders in the form of a dividend. The other half went to Yahoo’s cash reserves. None of it went to buy a company like Pinterest.</p><p>This still left Yahoo with about $40 billion worth of Alibaba buried in its valuation. It was a sufficiently tempting prize to draw more activist investors. Last year a notorious hedge funder named Jeffrey Smith of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/a-primer-on-starboard-the-activist-that-pushed-for-a-staples-office-depot-merger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starboard Value</a> bought a stake. Just like his predecessors, he wanted Yahoo to divest its Asian holdings and give the proceeds to shareholders. He expressed his feelings in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/starboard-delivers-letter-to-ceo-and-board-of-directors-of-yahoo-inc-277223182.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">a letter to Yahoo</a>. He also felt that instead of wasting money restoring an Internet icon, Yahoo should merge with AOL and lay off what would then be redundant employees. And Yahoo should make no more acquisitions, he declared.</p><p>Other investors with similar sentiments tried to put pressure on Yahoo. They wrote one essay after another in various magazines, attacking Mayer and urging her to unlock the value of the Alibaba stake so shareholders could feast on it. Mayer could ignore essays. But she did not want these wealthy malcontents to run riot at Yahoo’s next shareholder meeting. And apparently, she was now willing to separate Alibaba from Yahoo’s valuation.</p><p>So in January 2015, Mayer announced what she hopes will be the resolution to the struggle.</p><p>Yahoo will take all its remaining Alibaba shares and put them in a brand new company that does nothing but hold those shares. Because it is a spin-off company, Yahoo is calling it SpinCo. Current shareholders will get one share each of SpinCo and Yahoo. From the time the arrangement begins, late this year, the two companies will be entirely separate.</p><p>The plan was set up in that fashion so as to separate Yahoo from its Alibaba shares without a big tax bill, unlike the previous deals where much of the proceeds were eaten up by the government. (The new company will also include a unit called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yahoosmallbusiness.tumblr.com/post/109624934574/yahoo-small-business…oc_trk=ma&amp;soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma&amp;soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yahoo Small Business</a>, which makes custom websites. It’s in there because of regulatory reasons I won’t go into.)</p><p>Investors who don’t care about Yahoo but care very much about Alibaba can simply buy shares in SpinCo. The remaining core business, Yahoo, will then have a valuation reflecting what the world thinks the actual company is worth. Well, not exactly. Yahoo will still own the $7 billion Yahoo Japan stake.</p><p>Still, Yahoo’s valuation will be more reflective of its actual worth. Mayer thinks it should be a lot. “It’s sort of funny,” she says, “because as I was preparing my earnings script for the Q4 earnings call, I put a line in saying that, if broken out on its own, [Yahoo] would clearly be one of the fastest growing startups in the world. And legal asked, are you sure? I told them, I’m not sure that I can point to anything that’s growing faster than that.”</p></div><div><figure><div><img src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*feVUJs5xDp1t3-IA7Hbnxg.png\"></div><figcaption>Marissa Mayer</figcaption></figure></div></div></div>",

A&nbsp;Y Combinator-backed startup called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.outbound.io/\">Outbound</a> wants to help today’s marketers run campaigns that go beyond just tracking “opens and clicks,” and can also reach customers using mobile-friendly channels like push notifications, SMS and even in-app messages.</p>\n<p>The problem is something with which Outbound’s co-founders,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvkaran\">Dhruvkaran Mehta</a> and&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/joshweissburg\">Josh Weissburg</a>, are personally familiar. The two previously worked together at the car-sharing company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/getaround\">Getaround</a>, where Weissburg was focused on activation and&nbsp;Mehta was the engineer who worked on growth alongside him.</p>\n<p>At Getaround, one of the challenges Weissburg faced was getting car owners who were listing their vehicles on the service&nbsp;to finish the process of creating their profile, he explains. People would get stuck on different steps and would just drop off. He then needed to be able to reach these particular customers wherever they were at the time – on the web or on mobile, for example – and encourage&nbsp;them to take&nbsp;the next action needed to complete the process.</p>\n<p>Setting up these targeted campaigns to reach the customers in question across the various channels was a huge pain on the engineering side, says&nbsp;Weissburg. But&nbsp;the experience gave them the idea to build a product that would make it easier for non-technical people – like marketers – to more easily send out these sorts&nbsp;messages, and figure out what works and what doesn’t.</p>\n<p>In summer 2013, the two began building what has now become <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.outbound.io/\">Outbound</a>, a service that not only lets marketers automate campaigns and send out messages to users based on specific triggers, but also test multiple campaigns against each other and a control group,&nbsp;among other things.</p>\n<div>\n    <ol><li>\n\t\t            \n\t\t            <h3>outbound1</h3>\n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t        </li><li>\n\t\t            \n\t\t            <h3>outbound2</h3>\n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t        </li><li>\n\t\t            \n\t\t            <h3>outbound3</h3>\n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t        </li><li>\n\t\t            \n\t\t            <h3>outbound4</h3>\n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t        </li></ol>\n\t    \n\t    \n\t</div>\n<p>“As businesses realize that populations are moving mobile and most of their revenue is coming from there, they need to start engaging those audiences and keep people coming back to their mobile properties,” Mehta explains. “But what happens is that a lot of the techniques that apply to email are not really applicable to push notifications…We believe, fundamentally, that companies can make more money by sending fewer, but better messages,” he adds.</p>\n<p>That is, the businesses need a solution that not only treats mobile as a first-class citizen when it comes to marketing automation, but also helps the business figure out what’s the best means of reaching those customers and then measuring if their goals were met.</p>\n<p>Instead of just getting customers to open an email and click a link, for example, a business using Outbound may&nbsp;be trying to get users to complete a profile, add payment information, finish a&nbsp;sign-up process, fill in missing information, upgrade an account, and so on.</p>\n<p>With Outbound’s service, marketers don’t have to sit down and have lengthy conversations with their company’s engineering&nbsp;team to build out their messaging platform, or turn to sometimes&nbsp;expensive marketing automation software that can&nbsp;fail to address their need for a multi-channel strategy. Instead, marketers can go online to Outbound’s website to&nbsp;start immediately creating their desired campaign, including information like what user actions will kick it off, what they want users to do in return, and how (e.g. push, email, SMS) they want to reach those users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/anotb_whitebackground.png?w=680&amp;h=486\" alt=\"AnotB_whitebackground\" width=\"680\"></p>\n<p>The service then&nbsp;returns a “to do” list customers&nbsp;can bring to their developers that tells them the exact API calls to make. Or, in the case of those who are already sending their data to the online hub at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://segment.com/\">Segment.com</a>, using Outbound is only a matter of toggling a switch to turn it on.</p>\n<p>After the campaigns are running, marketers can watch the results in real-time on Outbound’s online dashboard, as well as track historical data and trends.</p>\n<p>The company first launched its service publicly in&nbsp;summer 2014, at which time it was focused more on funnel messages. Earlier this year, however, it expanded to include support for more sophisticated logic and A/B testing. Pricing for the service ranges from $149/month (2,000 active users) to $899/month (30,000 users) depending on company size. (The pricing is based on the number of active users being messaged, but not how many messages are sent out.)</p>\n<p>Today, Outbound is working with 16 companies including those in the educational space, financial services, and&nbsp;healthcare&nbsp;in particular. Some of its customers include&nbsp;HealthLoop, uBiome, eTherapi, GetSmarter, and Omada Health, to name a few.</p>\n<p>San Francisco-based Outbound is backed by $1.5 million in funding from Y Combinator,&nbsp;Paul Willard of Subtraction Capital, Doug Pepper of InterWest Partners, Trevor Kienzle from Correlation Ventures, plus YC’s Garry Tan and Alexis Ohanian.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n</div>",

Prototyped in 1975 by Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, with assistance from Steve Jobs, the other co-founder of Apple, Breakout is a variant of Pong, in which a player knocks bricks from a wall by hitting a ball against it. After half an hour of play, the A.I. program is doing about as well as I would, which is to say not very—but it is trying to move its paddle toward the ball, apparently grasping the rudiments of the game. After another thirty minutes, two hundred rounds in, the A.I. has become a talented amateur: it misses the ball only every third or fourth time. The audience laughs; isn’t this cool?</p> <p>Then something happens. By the three hundredth game, the A.I. has stopped missing the ball. The auditorium begins to buzz. Demis Hassabis, the program’s creator, advances to the next clip in his video presentation. The A.I. uses four quick rebounds to drill a hole through the left-hand side of the wall above it. Then it executes a killer bank shot, driving the ball into the hole and through to the other side, where it ricochets back and forth, destroying the entire wall from within. Now there are exclamations, applause, and shocked whispers from the crowd. Hours after encountering its first video game, and without any human coaching, the A.I. has not only become better than any human player but has also discovered a way to win that its creator never imagined.</p> <p>Today, in a <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14236\" target=\"_blank\">paper published in <em><i>Nature</i></em></a>, Hassabis and his colleagues Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and David Silver reveal that their A.I. has since achieved the same feat with an angling game (Fishing Derby, 1980), a driving game (Freeway, 1981), an armored-vehicle game (Robot Tank, 1983), a martial-arts game (Kung-Fu Master, 1984), and twenty-five others. In more than a dozen of them, including Stargunner and Crazy Climber, from 1982, it made the best human efforts look pathetic. The <em><i>Nature</i></em> article appears just over a year after Hassabis’s company, DeepMind, made its public début; Google bought the firm for six hundred and fifty million dollars in January, 2014, soon after Hassabis first demonstrated his program’s superhuman gaming abilities, at a machine-learning workshop in a Harrah’s casino on the edge of Lake Tahoe. That program, the DeepMind team now claims, is a “novel artificial agent” that combines two existing forms of brain-inspired machine intelligence: a deep neural network and a reinforcement-learning algorithm.</p> <p>Deep neural networks rely on layers of connections, known as nodes, to filter raw sensory data into meaningful patterns, just as neurons do in the brain. Apple’s Siri uses such a network to decipher speech, sorting sounds into recognizable chunks before drawing on contextual clues and past experiences to guess at how best to group them into words.&nbsp;Siri’s deductive powers improve (or ought to) every time you speak to her or correct her mistakes. The same technique can be applied to decoding images. To a computer with no preëxisting knowledge of brick walls or kung fu, the pixel data that it receives from an Atari game is meaningless. Rather than staring uncomprehendingly at the noise, however, a program like DeepMind’s will start analyzing those pixels—sorting them by color, finding edges and patterns, and gradually developing an ability to recognize complex shapes and the ways in which they fit together.</p> <p>The program’s second, complementary form of intelligence—reinforcement learning—allows for a kind of unsupervised obedience training. DeepMind’s A.I. starts each game like an unhousebroken puppy. It is programmed to find a score rewarding, but is given no instruction in how to obtain that reward. Its first moves are random, made in ignorance of the game’s underlying logic. Some are rewarded with a treat—a score—and some are not. Buried in the DeepMind code, however, is an algorithm that allows the juvenile A.I. to analyze its previous performance, decipher which actions led to better scores, and change its future behavior accordingly. Combined with the deep neural network, this gives the program more or less the qualities of a good human gamer: the ability to interpret the screen, a knack for learning from past mistakes, and an overwhelming drive to win.</p> <p>Whipping humanity’s ass at Fishing Derby may not seem like a particularly noteworthy achievement for artificial intelligence—nearly two decades ago, after all, I.B.M.’s Deep Blue computer beat Garry Kasparov, a chess grandmaster, at his own more intellectually aspirational game—but according to Zachary Mason, a novelist and computer scientist, it actually is. Chess, he noted, has an extremely limited “feature space”; the only information that Deep Blue needed to consider was the positions of the pieces on the board, during a span of not much more than a hundred turns. It could play to its strengths of perfect memory and brute-force computing power. But in an Atari game, Mason said, “there’s a byte or so of information per pixel” and hundreds of thousands of turns, which adds up to much more and much messier data for the DeepMind A.I. to process. In this sense, a game like Crazy Climber is a closer analogue to the real world than chess is, and in the real world humans still have the edge. Moreover, whereas Deep Blue was highly specialized, and preprogrammed by human grandmasters with a library of moves and rules, DeepMind is able to use the same all-purpose code for a wide array of games.</p> <a target=\"_blank\"></a><a target=\"_blank\"></a><p>That adaptability holds promise. Hassabis has begun partnering with satellite operators and financial institutions to see whether his A.I. could eventually “play” their data sets, perhaps learning to make weather predictions or trade oil futures. In the short term, though, his team has a more modest next step in mind: to design a program that can play video games from the nineteen-nineties. Hassabis, who began working as a game designer in 1994, at the age of seventeen, and whose first project was the Golden Joystick-winning Theme Park, in which players got ahead by, among other things, hiring restroom-maintenance crews and oversalting snacks in order to boost beverage sales, is well aware that DeepMind’s current system, despite being state of the art, is at least five years away from being a decade behind the gaming curve. Indeed, the handful of games in which DeepMind’s A.I. failed to achieve human-level performance were the ones that required longer-term planning or more sophisticated pathfinding—Ms. Pac-Man, Private Eye, and Montezuma’s Revenge. One solution, Hassabis suggested, would be to make the A.I. bolder in its decision-making, and more willing to take risks. Because of the rote reinforcement learning, he said, “it’s overexploiting the knowledge that it already knows.”</p> <p>In the longer term, after DeepMind has worked its way through Warcraft, StarCraft, and the rest of the Blizzard Entertainment catalogue, the team’s goal is to build an A.I. system with the capability of a toddler. But this, Hassabi said, they are nowhere near reaching. For one thing, he explained, “toddlers can do transfer learning—they can bring to bear prior knowledge to a new situation.” In other words, a toddler who masters Pong is likely to be immediately good at Breakout, whereas the A.I. has to learn both from scratch. Beyond that challenge lies the much thornier question of whether DeepMind’s chosen combination of a deep neural network and reinforcement learning could, on its own, ever lead to conceptual cognition—not only a fluency with the mechanics of, say, 2001’s Sub Command but also an understanding of what a submarine, water, or oxygen are. For Hassabis, this is “an open question.”</p> <p>Zachary Mason is less sanguine. “Their current line of research leads to StarCraft in five or ten years and Call of Duty in maybe twenty, and controllers for drones in live battle spaces in maybe fifty,” he told me. “But it never, ever leads to a toddler.” Most toddlers cannot play chess <em><i>or</i></em> StarCraft. But they can interact with the real world in sophisticated ways. “They can find their way across a room,” Mason said. “They can see stuff, and as the light and shadows change they can recognize that it’s still the same stuff. They can understand and manipulate objects in space.” These kinds of tasks—the things that a toddler does with ease but that a machine struggles to grasp—cannot, Mason is convinced, be solved by a program that excels at teaching itself Breakout. They require a model of cognition that is much richer than what Atari, or perhaps any gaming platform, can offer. Hassabis’s algorithm represents a genuine breakthrough, but it is one that reinforces just how much distance remains between artificial intelligence and the human mind.</p>     \n  \n\n\n<nav>\n    \n</nav>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>",

Those are the elements of our monoid – but we need more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>binary operation</em>: the concatenation of two lists will do (it’s <code>@</code> in F#) </li>\n<li><em>neutral element</em>: the empty list.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are programmers so let’s warp this into a record:</p>\n<pre title=\"\">type Monoid&lt;'a&gt; =\n    {\n        neutral : 'a\n        op      : 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a\n    }\n\nmodule Examples=\n    let listM&lt;'l&gt; : Monoid&lt;List&lt;'l&gt;&gt; =\n        {\n            neutral = []\n            op      = fun a b -&gt; a @ b\n        }\n</pre>\n<h2><span>Definition and Axioms</span></h2>\n<p>Of course it is math so there is a formal definition:</p>\n<p>A <strong>Monoid</strong> \\( (M, \\cdot) \\) is a <em>set</em> \\(M\\) equipped with a <em>binary operation</em>: \\( \\cdot : M \\times M \\rightarrow M \\) that satisfies the following <strong>axioms</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the operation is <strong>associative</strong>. For each \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) we can choose from \\(M\\) the following holds: $$( a \\cdot b ) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$$</li>\n<li>there is a <strong>neutral Element</strong> \\(\\mathbf{e} \\in M\\): For each \\(a \\in M\\) $$ \\mathbf{e} \\cdot a = a \\cdot \\mathbf{e} = a $$.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s use <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsCheck\" target=\"_blank\">FsCheck</a> to see if we can find any issues with those Axioms and our lists:</p>\n<pre title=\"\">module ``check Monoid axioms`` =\n    type T   = List&lt;int&gt;\n    let  M   = Examples.listM&lt;int&gt;\n    let  Z   = M.neutral\n    let (++) = M.op\n\n    [&lt;Property&gt;]\n    let ``Z is the neutral element``(v : T) =\n        Z ++ v = v &amp;&amp; v ++ Z = v\n\n    [&lt;Property&gt;]\n    let ``the operation is commutative``(a : T, b : T, c : T) =\n        a ++ (b ++ c) = (a ++ b) ++ c\n</pre>\n<p>The way I prepared this will make it easy to check other instances for us later – we just have to change the definition <code>T</code> and <code>M</code> at the beginning of the module.</p>\n<p>Sure enough all tests passes but for list we can really be <em>sure</em>:</p>\n<h2><span>a List <strong>is</strong> a monoid (proof)</span></h2>\n\n<h3>remark</h3>\n<p>You can skip this if you want – it will not help you gain insight into <strong>Monoids</strong> – see it as a bonus.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s proof the axioms but for this we need to know how <code>@</code> is implemented.

Felipe del Jesús Peréz García got dressed, said goodbye to his wife and kids, and drove off to work. It would be a two hour commute from their home in Monterrey, in Northeastern Mexico’s Nuevo León state, to Reynosa, in neighboring Tamaulipas state, where Felipe, an architect, would scout possible installation sites for cell phone towers for a telecommunications company before returning that evening.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat was the last time anyone saw him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFelipe’s wife, Tanya, is haunted by his disappearance. “All this time I’ve spent searching for his whereabouts,” she told me. Felipe was 26, with clear hazel eyes and a wide mouth, when he disappeared on March 19, 2013, just under two years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s a story, or lack thereof, that’s common across Mexico. People vanish, and the vast majority of cases aren’t solved for years, if they’re ever closed at all. Tanya is just one of the bereaved in an expanding web of loved ones and friends left with more questions than answers, and a collective resolve to seek justice for \n\t<em>los desaparecidos</em>.

They’re the Geek Squads to some of the biggest mafia-style organizations in the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s how Tanya sees it, at least. She looks at the rash of kidnapping cases across Mexico, many of which have taken place in Tamaulipas, targeted specifically at architects, engineers, and other information technology types, and can’t help but think Felipe was one of them. Nearly 40 information technology specialists have \n\t<a href=\"http://www.animalpolitico.com/esclavos-del-narco/\" target=\"_blank\">disappeared in Mexico s​ince 2008</a>, allegedly nabbed by the two dominant gangs in the region, the Cartel del Golfo or Los Zetas.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth of these cartels make money on diverse portfolios that include drug running, oil theft, extortion, and human trafficking. But we’re talking about decentralized profits on the global black market, so it’s difficult to put even ballpark figures on how many people are employed by these cartels or their yearly earnings. The \n\t<a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=drug+cartels+%2440+billion\" target=\"_blank\">general co​nsensus</a> is in the billions of dollars annually, and direct expanded networks that each employ in the mid tens of thousands of employees. To keep the wheels turning on such vast scales, the Golfo and Zetas use their own encrypted radio networks to communicate without authorities listening in. Those networks also intercept chatter from cops, the military, and other security forces. And the cartels need experts to build them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s known that these kind of people get kidnapped,” Tanya said, referring to telecommunications specialists like Felipe. “It’s real.” She tends to think her husband’s disappearance “may be related to the knowledge he has.”\n</p>\n\n\n*****\n\n<p>\n\tIt’s hard to say when “Radio Narco” went live. It was probably sometime in the mid to late 2000s, when the first reports of disappeared cell network workers began trickling out of Northeastern Mexico.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was \n\t<a href=\"http://www.insightcrime.org/categories/zetas-enslave-engineers-in-mexico\" target=\"_blank\">José Antonio ​Rebledo Fernández</a>, an engineer who was working for a construction company jointly owned by Mexican and American firms when he disappeared in January 2009. There was an IBM engineer, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/16/world/americas/mexico-disappeared/\" target=\"_blank\">Alejandro A​lfonso Moreno Baca</a>, who was kidnapped while driving from Monterrey to Laredo, Texas, in January 2011. In 2009, in perhaps the most famous mass kidnapping of specialists, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/11/zeta-radio/\" target=\"_blank\">nine&nbsp;contra​cted cell tower workers</a> vanished in the border town of Nuevo Laredo. The kidnappers, whoever they are, <a href=\"http://www.insightcrime.org/categories/zetas-enslave-engineers-in-mexico\" target=\"_blank\">came back l​ater</a> for the crew’s vehicles and kit.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.animalpolitico.com/esclavos-del-narco/\" target=\"_blank\">According to a report by Animal Politico</a>, an independent Mexico-based investigative media company, about the so-called “slaves of narco,” 36 communications specialists had gone missing in the region between 2008 and 2012. There have been no ransoms, and it’s unclear what sort of conditions kidnapped specialists are kept in.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\"I think they’re keeping him alive because he’s useful\"</h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tWe don’t know for sure how many hackers have been disappeared since—reliable numbers are hard to come by. Paris Martínez, the investigative journalist who authored the Animal Politico report, told me that’s because the former Felipe Calderón administration hid all that information, as part of its gusto for the war on drugs. “He didn’t put it out in order to minimize the issue,” Martínez said, and, to make matters worse, the current administration of Enrique Peña Nieto, of the Institutional Revolution Party, “has manipulated the information we have.” Which is, not much. “There is not a real and trustful source for information beyond the victims and their families.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA current high-ranking Mexican intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the people who have gathered evidence and data related to narcos kidnapping communications specialists “are not allowed to reveal any information.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we do know is that where people have disappeared, authorities have poked holes in the cartels’ clandestine communications complex. According to a former Mexican military expert on narcotics who spoke on condition of anonymity, whom I’ll call “G,”&nbsp;the military has “destroyed communications centers, communications towers, and even communications repeaters, that service the narcos” in places like Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Veracruz, and San Luis Potosí.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/19031/1425430360930545.png\" alt=\"\">\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMexico's states. <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Political_divisions_of_Mexico-en.svg\" target=\"_blank\">​Image: Wikimedia Commons</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause the bulk of these networks are installed in places that are difficult to access—in rural, not urban zones—rooting them out is not easy. Antennas and repeaters have been found staked on hilltops and high grounds in the Northeastern part of Mexico, a coveted port-of-entry into America for the Golfo and Zetas. (G considers the Golfo the pioneers of these hidden communications networks, and said the Zetas, a band of ex-Army commandos originally hired as Golfo’s assassins, applied Golfo’s knowledge of integrated technology to construct a similar secret radio grid after breaking away to form their own criminal outfit.) It could take five days’ walking into the bush to find this stuff, according to París Martínez; these stations are so remote, many draw energy from solar panels.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt would be a considerable undertaking to rig up elaborate radio stations in such inhospitable conditions, and across such vast expanses, if it weren’t for the fact that these cartels are already out there. This is where they thrive, where they evade authorities, deep in backcountry.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, when military patrols in those areas do manage to sniff out a cluster of radio gear, G told me, the objective is simple: dismantle everything on the spot. “Destroy them however you can depending on the type of material,” he said. “You don’t keep it, you don’t use it in government communications. You just destroy it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the Mexican Army orchestrated a 2011 bust on a Zetas network in Veracruz, officials razed 167 antennas and more than 150 repeaters, and confiscated 1,450 radios, 1,300 cellphones, and 1,350 NexTel gadgets. The kit comprised a communications network that spanned nearly 500 porous miles of Texas border and penetrated another 500 miles into Mexico’s brambly, mountainous interior, \n\t<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/12/09/143442365/mexico-busts-drug-cartels-private-phone-networks\" target=\"_blank\">as NPR rep​orted at the time</a>. It took 70 computers to control the sprawling system, which covered three states: Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí, and Tamaulipas.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMexican authorities confiscated 76 antennas, 81 repeaters, 655 handheld radios, 400 cell phones, 391 NexTel devices, and 19 computers in Reynosa and Tamaulipas in 2011, \n\t<a href=\"http://www.valleycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=692821#.VPY497PF_fd\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Associated Pre​ss</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.animalpolitico.com/2012/10/esclavos-del-narco-los-esclavos-especializados/\" target=\"_blank\">in 2​012</a>, the Mexican Army and Navy destroyed seven antennas and 20 repeaters in Sonora, an antenna and a repeater in Chihuahua, 13 antennas in Veracruz, a pair of antennas and a repeater in Tamaulipas, and 50 meters of antennas and a repeater along the Monterrey-Nuevo Laredo highway.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Mexican Army and Navy both declined requests for comment. The Mexican government also did not respond to my queries for the total number of disappeared specialists and confiscated radio towers and antennas in Northeastern Mexico between 2012 and 2014 by the time this story went to press.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2Maqi5O1A8\">\n</iframe>\n<p>\n\tMexican Navy officials show off confiscated Zetas radio kit to the press, Veracruz, 2011.&nbsp;\n\t<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2Maqi5O1A8\" target=\"_blank\">​Video: Reforma/YouTube</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\tWhy build sprawling, difficult-to-maintain hidden radio networks? The same reason cartels do anything: profits. For the cartels, better communication means more money, said Tristan Reed, a Mexican security analyst with the global intelligence firm Stratfor. Running a profitable crime syndicate is “a business of who you know,” Reed told me. “And being a business of who you know means communication needs to be flawless.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“You need to be able to communicate in an environment where you’re constantly having rivals trying to kill you, and law enforcement and military officials trying to arrest you,” Reed explained. From high-level capos coordinating drug shipments and militant-style offenses, to small-time neighborhood bosses who need to communicate with scouts who track the movements of the police or military, Reed said crime syndicates must diversify their communications toolkit if they want to keep making money. “Cartels understand the necessity of this.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s not just radio networks, of course. Those are “just one of many ways they’re going to communicate with one another, and it can get very technical, whether it’s satellite phones, cell phones, email, or \n\t<a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/cartel-kidnapping-spreads-terror-on-twitter\" target=\"_blank\">social me​dia</a>,” Reed explained. He has even heard reports of video teleconferences taking place among cartel brass. “It’s all out there,” he told me. “But the makeshift radio networks are definitely impressive. They serve a very critical component of the need to communicate.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd to build and service these networks, the cartels need engineers.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n*****\n\n<p>\n\tFelipe graduated with a degree in architecture from the Monterrey Metropolitan University, and he always enjoyed designing houses in AutoCAD, the commercially available 2D and 3D computer-aided design software application. Whenever he looked at a house he would turn to Tanya, and say, “La voy a modificar.” He would make it better.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe got his start in communications infrastructure working for a construction company that surveyed possible cell tower sites for a&nbsp;larger telco. Felipe was laid off from that company before Grupo Construgest, S.A., an active telecommunications company, hired him. From there, he began working on architectural drawings for cell towers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Then, little by little, he was taking control of projects,” Tanya explained. “In some of them he was a supervisor.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFelipe was at Grupo Construgest for four years before he disappeared. Tanya told me he had previously done similar work for other major mobile phone operators in Mexico, including Telcel, Unefon, and Movistar. None of these companies, including NexTel, responded to requests for comment, and Jesus Tinajero Morales, Felipe’s boss at Grupo Construgest, could not be reached for comment.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFelipe was a serious person, even “self-centered,” in Tanya’s words. But the demands of Felipe’s job meant he had to talk to lots of people, and move around the region a fair bit. “He managed the whole project,” Tanya explained, from permit negotiations to the actual architectural drawings of the proposed radio sites. Before he could survey potential tower sites the day he vanished, Felipe had to seek permission from the city council to build. He also regularly had to petition and collect signatures from the locals wherever Grupo Construgest had plans to build antennas; Tanya told me a lot of residents weren’t happy at the thought of looming radio towers cropping up on their land.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Felipe was a quiet man, through and through. In Monterrey, he played \n\t<em>el bajo sexto</em>, a 12-stringed guitar, in a traditional norteño band. Felipe was not aggressive, Tanya said. “Not at all.” Each day when he got home from work, the first thing Felipe did was spend time with his two children. Sometimes he’d take them to the park, other times he’d pull up videos for them on YouTube.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen he left that morning he had been tasked with returning to Monterrey with GPS coordinates for three potential cell tower installation sites. It was a routine assignment, though not without risk: Felipe was headed into the country, into the heart of Zetas turf, where the situation “is complicated,” Tanya said.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFelipe would get the job done as quick as possible then, and be on the road back to Reynosa before dusk.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“If I don’t find anything I’ll leave,” he told Tanya. Then he drove off.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLater, around 1 PM, Felipe phoned Tanya with an update: He’d found good land, ideal for installing towers. But, “there’s no one out here,” he told his wife. “I’m alone.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter the day’s search, Felipe was set to make the two-and-a-half hour drive back to Monterrey. When Tanya called him around 3 or 4 PM to check in, his phone rang and then went to voicemail. When she tried again, shortly thereafter, his phone went straight to voicemail.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTanya doesn’t know anything beyond that. “They never spoke to us about a rescue,” she explained, referring to what many citizens believe to be unwillingness on the part of local and national authorities to investigate kidnapping cases. She said the car is still missing.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\"I would suggest that enslaving hacker squads would get you in major trouble as a cartel since these innovative, smart individuals would turn the tables on you the first chance they got\"</h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tIn 2011, the Mexican Senate’s security commission acknowledged the cases of disappeared IT specialists. Animal Politico \n\t<a href=\"http://www.animalpolitico.com/esclavos-del-narco/\" target=\"_blank\">​reports</a>&nbsp;how Felipe González González, president of the Senate security commission from 2006 to 2012, held firm during security meetings after the Army and Navy seized cartel radio gear: “I’m sure the missing specialists were forced to build this infrastructure,” González said.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was people with the same profile,” González told me, when asked about what led him to believe cartels were kidnapping specialists like Felipe. González, who left public office in 2012, said information about the conditions kidnapped hackers are kept in is classified.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRobert J. Bunker, an adjunct research professor at the Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, isn’t so sure the theory that cartels are kidnapping IT talent holds up. He couldn’t provide any definitive information on these incidents—not many people can—but said a cartel like the Zetas probably isn’t likely to enslave, or even hire mercenary IT talent because the gang can’t afford a whistleblower bringing the whole thing down.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I would suggest that enslaving hacker squads would get you in major trouble as a cartel,” Bunker told me, “since these innovative, smart individuals would turn the tables on you the first chance they got.” Think Mayday or other distress signals. “Would the Zetas really rely upon and force slaves to build and maintain encrypted communications infrastructure?” he asked. “Way too much risk involved.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides, Bunker said, “hackers tend to be prima donnas and anti-system types who don't function well in captivity. They would fall apart mentally if brutalized by cartel enforcers.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tStratfor’s Tristan Reed thinks it’s feasible. “There are so many reports out there that make you wonder the odds are some have to be true, right?” he said. However he does proceed with caution on the assumptions that are drawn simply because extortion, be it through retributions for failing to make payments or kidnapping for ransom, is “rampant” in Mexico.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“There’s no specific demographic now in Mexico that is not targeted for extortion or kidnapping,” Reed told me. “And engineers can be just as frequently targeted.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen again, Reed said this sort of hacking isn’t beyond the scope of people with even a basic understanding of how radio works. “While these networks are very technical—they’re very efficient, and can spread over very long distances, and be very complex—the technology being used is actually not that sophisticated. It’s not something outside of anyone who specializes in radio communications,” he explained. “Cartels have billions of dollars. They don’t necessarily have to kidnap someone to carry out building the infrastructure.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, a twist in the theory: Why kidnap people when you could make them voluntarily join your team? As the high-ranking intelligence official put it, “You can speculate without any limitation that due to the great corruption and co-optation capabilities of organized crime they can hire the best professionals and technicians in the world.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBunker said it would seem “‘buying talent,’ especially high tech talent, would be preferential to ‘enslaving’ it.” If a cartel is thinking strategically, he explained, it could pay for college-level computer science and computer security degrees for promising recruits and/or relatives of gang personnel. Funding four or five years for a bachelor’s in science, and a few more years for a master’s degree, would give you a functioning engineer or computer scientist. It’s yet another way for the cartel to secure talent and ensure loyalty to the gang, Bunker told me. Total initial investment? Under $250,000 for tuition, room and board, and stipend, he said, depending on the university. A small expense for gangs that bring in&nbsp;billions of dollars annually.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTanya isn’t convinced. Felipe was kidnapped, she said. “There’s simply no other logical explanation.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tG, the former counternarcotics official with the Mexican government, said some specialists are still “obligated” to work for the cartels, disappeared against their wills and forced to service Radio Narco. But, increasingly, there are also those who are lured to work voluntarily for the cartels. The gangs either pay for the recruits’ advanced degrees, offer them high-salaried jobs, or both.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“There’s not only kidnappings,” he said. “I certainly know that a lot of criminals are sending their kids, their nephews, family, young people to be educated.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are kidnapped, though, G said whistleblowing would get you killed. Send a Mayday, and you’re done. “It’s true that the Army and other security forces can intercept the network,” G said, “but the criminals are the ones who use them. If you send a help message it would be suicide.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/19031/1424726613313823.png\" alt=\"\">​\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFelipe in 2012.&nbsp;\n\t<inline>Photo: Tanya Elizabeth Gonzalez Vaya. Used with permission.</inline>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis month, Tanya and other members of a Monterrey-based support group for families of missing people will take to the streets, demanding justice for \n\t<em>los desaparecidos</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThey call themselves \n\t<a href=\"http://www.cadhac.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ciudadanos en Apoyo a Los Derech​os Humanos</a>, or Citizens Who Support Human Rights, and, along with a similar group from Nuevo León, will march on the local court. Tanya expects 40 or 50 people in total at the public action. One by one they will go in, and ask the public ministry about their cases.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We ask for justice, only justice,” she said. “To see their cases resolved. We want results.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTanya’s imploring the government to figure out what happened because she doesn’t necessarily think the telcos should be held accountable for the disappearance of her husband or the other missing IT specialists. “The insecurity problem belongs to the government,” she said. “I mean, here in Tamaulipas, anywhere, I think the government is the one who has to make us secure enough to go and work without risk.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn G’s eyes, the government and the telcos share responsibility. But perhaps no entity is equipped, in the end, to stop the problem. The telcos have neither the money nor the security necessary to protect against the threat of cartels seeking technical specialists, G told me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“They can’t legally do it,” he said. And “it’s impossible for the government to have the means, not even the United States or any other country’s security forces can offer protection to every communications engineer. The government has certain responsibilities for protecting its people, but they can’t be responsible for the security of every citizen. It’s impossible.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne thing is for sure: Radio Narco will stay on. G told me about how quickly the cartels would reinstall radio kit after his people made busts and destroyed the gear. It was classic Whac-A-Mole. To stop the illegal installation of radio masts and repeaters, he said, “we need to have people in these areas, where these criminals are, all the time. That’s impossible.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe might never know just how many of \n\t<em>los desaparecidos</em> should be counted among the dead. An estimated 120,000 to 125,000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006, \n\t<a href=\"https://justiceinmexico.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/130206-dvm-2013-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">accor​ding to the Trans-Border Institute</a>, and it’s anyone’s guess if Felipe is one of them. For now, Tanya waits for the phone to ring, hopeful her husband is still alive despite the time that has passed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think they’re keeping him alive because he’s useful,” she said. “They’re all useful people.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>With additional reporting by Rafael Castillo, Bernardo Loyola, and Camilo Salas.</em>\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>",

But maybe one day [majestic orchestral flourish].” Great. You wanted <cite>Finding Nemo</cite> and got <cite>Not Finding Nemo</cite> instead.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn’t do that to you, friends. This is your guide to creating style breakpoints for quantities of HTML elements, much as you already do with <code>@media</code> queries for viewport dimensions. I’m not pointing at some blurry specification in the distance or a twinkle in an implementer’s eye. We’re going to do this <em>today</em>, with CSS that’s already available.</p>\n\n<h2>Dynamic content</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design\" target=\"_blank\">Responsive web design</a> is primarily concerned with one variable: space. In testing responsive layouts, we take an amount of content and see which spaces it will successfully fit into. The content is deemed constant; the space, variable.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>@media</code> query is the darling of responsive web design because it allows us to insert “breakpoints” wherever one layout strategy ceases to be viable and another should succeed it. However, it’s not just viewport dimensions, but the <em>quantity</em> of content that can put pressure on space. </p>\n\n<p>Just as your end users are liable to operate devices with a multitude of different screen sizes, your content editors are liable to add and remove content. That’s what content management systems are for.&nbsp; This makes Photoshop mockups of web pages doubly obsolete: they are snapshots of just one viewport, with content in just one state.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, I will be outlining a technique to make CSS <em>quantity-aware</em> using specially formed selectors. I will be applying these selectors to one classic problem in particular: how to alter the display of items in a horizontal navigation menu when there are too many to suit the initial layout mode. That is, I will demonstrate how to switch from a <code>display: table-cell</code> to a <code>display: inline-block</code> layout when the number of items in the menu becomes “more than or equal to 6.”</p>\n\n<p>I will not be relying on any JavaScript or template logic, and the menu’s list markup will remain devoid of class attribution. By using CSS only, the technique honors the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#separation-of-concerns\" target=\"_blank\">separation of concerns</a> principle, according to which content (HTML) and presentation (CSS) have clearly defined roles. Layout is CSS’s job and, where possible, CSS’s only.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig1_menu.png\" alt=\"Comparing the initial menu bar layout for fewer than six items with the layout for six or more items\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>The demonstration is <a href=\"http://codepen.io/heydon/pen/QwjGZp\" target=\"_blank\">available on CodePen</a> and will be referred to throughout the article.</p>\n\n<p>To help me illustrate this qualification of quantity, I’ll be employing diagrams of squids in the article to represent HTML elements. Green squids with ticks represent elements that match the CSS selector in question, red squids with crosses are unselected elements, and grayed-out squids denote elements that don’t exist.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig2_squid.png\" alt=\"A key for the three squid symbols to be used in following diagrams. A green squid (for selected elements), a red squid (for unselected elements) and a grey squid for elements that don't exist\">\n</figure>\n\n<h2>Counting</h2>\n\n<p>The key to determining the quantity of elements in a given context is to count them. CSS doesn’t provide an explicit “counting API,” but we can solve the same problem with an inventive combination of selectors.</p>\n\n<h3>Counting to one</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>:only-child</code> selector provides a means to style elements if they appear in isolation. Essentially, it lets us “style all the child elements of a particular element, if counting those children returns 1 as the total.” Aside from its stablemate <code>:only-of-type</code>, it is the only simple selector that can be described as quantity-based.</p>\n\n<p>In the following example, I use <code>:only-of-type</code> to add a special style to any buttons that are the <em>only</em> elements of their element type among sibling elements. I give these lone buttons an increased <code>font-size</code> because singularity suggests importance.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nbutton { \n  font-size: 1.25em;\n}\n\nbutton:only-of-type {\n  font-size: 2em;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here’s the crucial part. If I were to start out with one button, replete with a larger font size, and add buttons before or after it, <em>each</em> button would then adopt a smaller font size. The style of all the elements in the set is dependent on a quantity threshold of two: if there are “fewer than two” elements, the larger font size is honored. Take a look at that code again with the “fewer than two” notion in mind:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nbutton {\n  font-size: 1.25em;\n}\n\nbutton:only-of-type {\n  font-size: 2em;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig3_fewerthan.png\" alt=\"The fewer than two logic means one selected element (green squid) becomes two unselected elements (red squids) when an element is added\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>If it feels more natural, you can turn the CSS logic on its head using <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/n/not/\" target=\"_blank\">negation</a> and make the condition “more than one.”</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n/* \"More than one\" results in a smaller font size */\nbutton {\n  font-size: 2em;\n}\n\nbutton:not(:only-of-type) {\n  font-size: 1.25em;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig4_morethan.png\" alt=\"The more than one logic means one unselected element (red squid) becomes two selected elements (green squids) when an element is added\">\n</figure>\n\n<h3>Quantity <i>n</i></h3>\n\n<p>Styling elements based on the “more than one” and “fewer than two” thresholds is a neat trick, but a flexible “quantity query” interface would accept any quantity. That is, I should be able to style “more than or equal to <i>n</i>” for any value of <i>n</i>. Then I can style “more than or equal to 6” in our navigation menu.</p>\n\n<p>With a view to achieving this final goal, what if I were able to style discrete quantities like “exactly 6 in total” or “exactly 745”? How would I go about that? I would need to use a selector that allowed me to traverse sets of elements of any quantity numerically.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, the <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/n/nth-last-child/\" target=\"_blank\"><code>:nth-last-child(n)</code> selector</a> accepts the number “<i>n</i>”, enabling me to count sets of elements from the <em>end</em> of the set toward the beginning. For example, <code>:nth-last-child(6)</code> matches the element that is sixth from last among sibling elements.</p>\n\n<p>Things get interesting when concatenating <code>:nth-last-child(6)</code> with <code>:first-child</code>, introducing a second condition. In this case, I am looking for any element that is <em>both</em> the sixth element from the end <em>and</em> the first element.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nli:nth-last-child(6):first-child {\n  /* green squid styling */\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If this element exists, the set of elements <em>must be exactly six</em> in quantity. Somewhat radically, I have written CSS that tells me how many elements I am looking at.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig5_firstchild.png\" alt=\"Of six squids, the first is green and the rest red. The first is subject to the nth-last-child(6) selector as well as the first-child selector\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>All that remains is to leverage this key element to style the remaining elements in the set. For this, I employ the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_selectors\" target=\"_blank\">general sibling combinator</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig6_firstchild_li.png\" alt=\"Six green squids because the first green squid is combined with the general sibling combinator to make all the red squids that follow green\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>If you’re not familiar with the general sibling combinator, the <code>~ li</code> in <code>li:nth-last-child(6):first-child ~ li</code> means “any <code>li</code> elements that occur after <code>li:nth-last-child(6):first-child</code>.” In the following example, the elements each adopt a green font color if there are <em>precisely</em> six of them in total.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nli:nth-last-child(6):first-child, \nli:nth-last-child(6):first-child ~ li {\n  color: green;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>More than or equal to 6</h2>\n\n<p>Targeting a discrete quantity—whether it’s 6, 19, or 653—is not especially useful because it pertains to such a specific situation. Using discrete widths rather than <code>min-width</code> or <code>max-width</code> in our <code>@media</code> queries would be similarly unhelpful:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n@media screen and (width: 500px) {\n  /* styles for exactly 500px wide viewports */\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/content-aware-navigation/\" target=\"_blank\">the navigation menu</a>, I really want to switch layouts at a <em>threshold</em>: a quantity watershed. I want to switch at six <em>or more</em> items—not <em>exactly</em> six items. When I reach that threshold, I  would like to change from a distributed table layout to a simpler, wrappable <code>inline-block</code> configuration. Importantly, I would like to <em>retain</em> that switched configuration as the number of items further increases. </p>\n\n<p>The question is, how does one begin to construct such a selector? It’s a question of <em>offsets</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>The <i>n</i>+6 argument</h3>\n\n<p>Another arithmetical argument adoptable by the <code>:nth-child()</code> selector takes the form “<i>n</i> + [integer]”. For example, <code>:nth-child(n+6)</code> styles all the elements in a set starting from the sixth.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig7_adinfinitum.png\" alt=\"A set of red squids that become green at the sixth squid for the remainder of the set (which can be of any size), counting upwards.\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>Though this has conceivable applications all its own, it’s not a “quantity-aware” selection method as such: we’re not styling anything because there are six elements or more in total; we’re just styling the ones that happen to enumerate higher than five.</p>\n\n<p>To begin solving the problem properly, what we really need is to create a set of elements that excludes the last five items. Using the opposite of <code>:nth-child(n+6)</code>—<code>:nth-last-child(n+6)</code>—I can apply the switched layout properties to all “last elements” <em>starting from the sixth</em>, counting back toward the beginning of the set.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nli:nth-last-child(n+6) {\n  /* properties here */\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This omits the last five items from a set of any length, meaning that when you reduce the length of the set below six, you cease to see any selected items. It’s a sort of “sliding doors” effect.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig8_slidingdoors.png\" alt=\"A set of green squids (to the left) and red squids (to the right) become a set of just red squids when the set becomes fewer than six in number\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>If, indeed, the set is greater than or equal to six in total, then all that remains is to style those last five items as well. This is easy: where there are more than six items, one or more items that “return true” (in JavaScript-speak) for the <code>nth-last-child(n+6)</code> condition must exist. Any and all of these extant elements can be combined with “<code>~</code>” to affect all items (including the last five) that follow it.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig9_breakpoint.png\" alt=\"When a set of red squids has squids added to it, the squids to the right of the set become green and can be used to make the rest of the red squids green too (with the general sibling combinator)\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>The surprisingly terse solution to our problem is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nli:nth-last-child(n+6),\nli:nth-last-child(n+6) ~ li {\n  /* properties here */\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Naturally, 6 can be replaced with any positive integer, even 653,279.</p>\n\n<h2>Fewer than or equal to <i>n</i></h2>\n\n<p>As in the earlier <code>:only-of-type</code> example, you can turn the logic on its head, switching from “more than or equal to <i>n</i>” to “fewer than or equal to <i>n</i>.” Which brand of logic you use depends on which state you consider the more natural default state. “Fewer than or equal to <i>n</i>” is possible by negating <i>n</i> and reinstating the <code>:first-child</code> condition.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nli:nth-last-child(-n+6):first-child,\nli:nth-last-child(-n+6):first-child ~ li {\n  /* properties here */\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In effect, the use of “-” switches the direction of the selection: instead of pointing toward the start from the sixth, it points toward the end from the sixth. In each case, the selector is inclusive of the sixth item.</p>\n\n<h3><code>nth-child</code> versus <code>nth-of-type</code></h3>\n\n<p>Note that I am using <code>:nth-child()</code> and <code>:nth-last-child()</code> in the preceding examples, not <code>:nth-of-type()</code> and <code>:nth-last-of-type()</code>. Because I am dealing in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s are the only legitimate children of <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>s, <code>:last-child()</code> and <code>:last-of-type()</code> would both work here.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>:nth-child()</code> and <code>:nth-of-type()</code> families of selectors have different advantages depending on what you are trying to achieve. Because <code>:nth-child()</code> is element agnostic, you could apply the described technique across different element type siblings:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;blockquote&gt;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n  &lt;figure&gt;...&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>\n.container &gt; :nth-last-child(n+3),\n.container &gt; :nth-last-child(n+3) ~ * {\n  /* properties here */\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Note how I am using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors\" target=\"_blank\">the universal selector</a> to maintain element agnosticism here. <code>:last-child(n+3) ~ *</code> means “any element of any type following <code>:last-child(n+3)</code>.”)</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of <code>:nth-last-of-type()</code>, on the other hand, is that you are able to target groups of like elements where other siblings of different types are present. For example, you could target the quantity of paragraphs in the following snippet, despite them being bookended by a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;blockquote&gt;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>\np:nth-last-of-type(n+6),\np:nth-last-of-type(n+6) ~ p {\n  /* properties here */\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Selector support</h2>\n\n<p>All of the CSS2.1 and CSS3 selectors used in this article are supported in <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sel3\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Explorer 9 and above</a>, including all reasonably recent mobile/handheld stock browsers. </p>\n\n<p>Internet Explorer 8 support is good for most selector types, but technically partial, so you might want to consider a JavaScript polyfill. Alternately, you could pair the selectors for the “safer” of the layout strategies with <a href=\"http://nicolasgallagher.com/better-conditional-classnames-for-hack-free-css/\" target=\"_blank\">IE9-specific classes</a>. In the case of the navigation menu, the safer option is the one catering to more items, using <code>inline-block</code>. The declaration block would look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nnav li:nth-last-child(n+6),\nnav li:nth-last-child(n+6) ~ li, \n\n.lt-ie9 nav li {\n  display: inline-block;\n  /* etc */\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>In the real world</h2>\n\n<p>Suppose our <a href=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/content-aware-navigation/\" target=\"_blank\">navigation menu</a> belongs to a content-managed site. Depending on who is administering the theme, it will be populated with a greater or fewer number of options. Some authors will keep things simple with just “Home” and “About” links provided, while others will cram their menu full of custom page and category options. </p>\n\n<p>By providing alternative layouts depending on the number of menu items present, we increase the elegance with which we tolerate different implementations of the theme: we address variable content as we might variable screen dimensions.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://alistapart.com/d/415/fig1_menu.png\" alt=\"Comparing the initial menu bar layout for fewer than six items with the layout for six or more items\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>So, there you have it: squid ahoy! You can now add quantity as a styling condition to your repertoire.</p>\n\n<h2>Content-independent design</h2>\n\n<p>Responsive web design solves an important problem: it makes the <em>same</em> content comfortably digestible between <em>different</em> devices. For folks to receive different content just because they have different devices would be unacceptable. Similarly, it’s unacceptable for a design to dictate the nature of the content. We wouldn’t tell an editor, “Lose that, will you? It makes the design look wrong.”</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<aside>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Also in Issue № 415</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2><a href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/stopping-the-infighting-about-digital-standards\" target=\"_blank\">Stopping the Infighting About Digital Standards</a></h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>by Lisa Welchman</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</aside>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>But what form the content takes, and how much of it there is at any one time, is frequently indeterminate—another unknown.

Image: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Advisory_Committee_for_Aeronautics#mediaviewer/File:NACA_seal.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">N​ASA</a>.</inline></p><p>\n\tThe creation of the NACA represents one of those classic “giant leap” moments in space history. But interestingly enough, its potential wasn’t recognized at the time of its conception at all. In fact, according to aviation and spaceflight historian Roger E. Bilstein, it was basically a politically expedient afterthought.</p><p>\n\t“The enabling legislation for the NACA slipped through almost unnoticed as a rider attached to the Naval Appropriation Bill, on 3 March 1915,” Bilstein wrote in his book <a href=\"https://engineering.purdue.edu/~andrisan/Courses/AAE190_Fall_2001/Orders_of_Magnitude.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Orders of Magnitude: A History of the NACA and​ NASA, 1915-1990</a>. “It was a traditional example of American political compromise.”</p><p>\n\tThis is understandable given the geopolitical climate of in 1915. Despite the early successes of the Wright brothers, Americans were lagging behind Europe when it came to aviation. From a military and scientific standpoint, it made sense to get up to speed on such revolutionary emerging technologies. Many public figures supported the formation of NACA, <a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/ch6.htm\" target=\"_blank\">incl​uding Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> who was then the Assistant Secretary of the Navy.</p><p>\n\tHowever, President Woodrow Wilson didn’t want to greenlight anything that seemed to threaten the United States’s status of nonintervention in the First World War. He believed establishing a national aviation and aeronautics laboratory was such a breach of neutrality, and so the act that formed NACA was slipped into the Naval Appropriation Bill to avoid notice.</p><p>\n\t<inline><inline>Wilson granted the newly formed committee fairly modest resources after its inception, including an annual budget of $5,000, or about $116,000 adjusted for inflation. The money was to be handled by </inline><a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/naca/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">an inaugural group of about ​20 individuals</a><inline> led by Brigadier General George Scriven.</inline>&nbsp;</inline></p><p><img src=\"http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/19539/1425335922600694.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><inline>An employee reads the NACA’s mission statement.

The facility included an atmospheric wind tunnel and a dynamometer laboratory, and was dedicated as the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in 1920. Langley had <a href=\"https://engineering.purdue.edu/~andrisan/Courses/AAE190_Fall_2001/Orders_of_Magnitude.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a staff of only 1​1 people</a> at the start; today its successor, NASA’s Langley Research Center, <a href=\"http://www.vasts.spacegrant.org/about/nasa\" target=\"_blank\">empl​oys well over 3,000</a>.</p><p>During the interwar period, the NACA carved out a profitable niche by designing ever more sophisticated aircraft. For example, its researchers developed an influential aerodynamic design <a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter1.html\" target=\"_blank\">known as NACA ​cowling</a> that dramatically reduced the drag on planes, thus increasing fuel efficiency. The widespread implementation of this concept produced aircraft that could fly much farther, longer, and faster.</p><p>The committee scored several other major aviation home runs in its half-century history. The NACA duct, introduced in 1945, prevented engine overheating by channeling cool air through key systems. Originally used to boost circulation in aircraft, these ducts are now also <a href=\"https://www.pegasusautoracing.com/group.asp?GroupID=DUCTNACA\" target=\"_blank\">a sta​ple of race car design</a> and other heat-sensitive mechanical systems. Among the NACA’s other greatest hits were its <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~cantwell/AA200_Course_Material/The%20NACA%20airfoil%20series.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ultra-efficie​nt airfoils (wing shapes)</a>, which are still used on <a href=\"http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/airfoils/q0060a.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">some m​odern fighter jets</a>, as well as the committee’s pioneering <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88368main_H-1836.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">wo​rk with supersonic flight</a> during the 1950s. &nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/19539/1425336009603301.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><inline>Curtiss AT-5A Hawk with NACA cowling at Langley, October 1928.

Most rocket scientists working in the 1920s and 1930s conducted research at academic institutions or private labs, and the NACA had no explicitly stated intentions to develop its own cadre of space specialists. </p><p>But as advances in rocketry accelerated leading up to the Second World War, the committee began to take spaceflight more seriously. The American investment in space research was almost entirely a military endeavor at first, aimed at producing high caliber missiles like the devastatingly lethal V-2 missile unleashed by the Nazis as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/v_weapons\" target=\"_blank\">a WWII “ven​geance weapon.”</a></p><p>These German missiles were <a href=\"http://www.dw.de/the-v-2-the-first-space-rocket/a-16276064\" target=\"_blank\">the first h​uman-made objects</a> ever to enter outer space; sadly, humanity’s first contact with the outside universe had less to do with exploration than it did with civilian annihilation. But in a weird twist of fate, the mastermind behind the V-2, Wernher von Braun, would also be the driving force behind the Apollo lunar landings some two decades later, after the NACA had been bolstered, and given a new name and direction.</p><p>When it became clear the Nazis were going to lose the war, von Braun surreptitiously arranged the surrender of himself and hundreds of his top rocket scientists to the United States as a part of a secret initiative called Operation Paperclip. The Truman administration agreed to overlook the team’s unsavory past, but in exchange, von Braun and his team were expected to build an American space program as sophisticated as any in the world.</p><p><img src=\"http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/19539/1425336034778279.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><inline>Wernher von Braun in right foreground of NACA meeting.

Von Braun is rightly a controversial figure, but there’s no denying that the man got results as soon as he was integrated into the NACA. Not only did he spearhead the development of powerful liquid-fuel rockets, culminating in the Apollo program’s Saturn V, he was also a beloved science communicator. His 1955 television collaboration with Walt Disney, called <em>Man in Space</em>, was one of the most popular specials in history, <a href=\"http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/disney_article.html\" target=\"_blank\">attracting 42 million ​viewers.</a></p><p>Indeed, despite von Braun’s central role in the development of the V-2, he was much more interested in space exploration and off-Earth civilian colonization than he was with building better weapons (not that he quit that line of work <a href=\"http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/bio.html\" target=\"_blank\">once he ​was stateside</a>, mind you). So when the Soviets shocked the world by launching Sputnik on October 4, 1957, von Braun was ready to take charge of the new era of American rocketry.</p><p>The NACA, however, was woefully unprepared for Sputnik. President Dwight Eisenhower recognized that the 42-year-old committee would need a substantive mid-century upgrade if it had any hope of competing with the advanced Soviet space program. </p><p>On July 29, 1958, he signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing NASA as the dominant American space agency (incidentally, <a href=\"http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_DARPA01.htm\" target=\"_blank\">DARPA was als​o founded in 1958</a>, in response to Sputnik). By October 1958, all of the NACA’s resources and employees had been integrated under this new banner, which remains among the most forceful leaders in spaceflight to this day.</p><p>It’s sobering to think of the enormous advances NASA, and by extension the NACA, has accomplished in only 100 years. When March 3, 1915 rolled by, the first Wright Brothers flights were still a complete novelty, and the notion of traveling beyond Earth would have seemed quixotic to most. </p><p>But in the ensuing decades, NASA has sent humans to the Moon, rovers to Mars, and  spacecraft into interstellar space, all while pioneering countless new technologies. In fact, NASA is itself currently experiencing another big shift in direction and focus, similar to the sea change that dissolved the NACA in 1958. </p><p>To keep competitive, NASA has outsourced much of the astrodynamic legwork to the private space industry, most famously subsidizing companies like SpaceX to complete cargo runs to and from International Space Station. </p><p>If that trend continues, NASA may revert back to more of an advisory role, similar to that of the early NACA. It may end up limiting its role to overseeing and awarding contracts to non-governmental facilities, rather than pursuing its own missions in-house. The evolution of American spaceflight is far from over, after all, and NASA is no longer the only player in the game.</p><p>To that point, the centennial of the day America’s dreams of conquering space raises an evocative question: What will the next century of American space exploration bring? If it is anywhere near as momentous and action-packed as the first century has been, then we are all in for a serious thrill ride. &nbsp;</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>",

    "title": "Evolving the Dart language with Dart Enhancement Proposals",
    "author": "Seth Ladd",
    "body": "<div>\n\n<div>\nIn July 2014, <a href=\"http://news.dartlang.org/2014/07/ecma-approves-1st-edition-of-dart.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ecma published the first version of the Dart language specification</a>. Ecma TC52 continues to release updated versions with new features (for example, <a href=\"http://news.dartlang.org/2014/12/enums-and-async-primitives-in-dart.html\" target=\"_blank\">async/await</a>). Our developers have asked for more insight into the discussion process, and for a formal way to seed the spec process with proposals. Today, we're happy to announce <a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals\" target=\"_blank\">Dart Enhancement Proposals</a> as the primary way for the Dart team and the larger Dart community to work together to evolve the Dart language and libraries.<br>\n<br>\nTo make a great language that can be used to write great programs means we need to work together. The DEP process is how we do that. We want to:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Create an open, collaborative, and inclusive Dart ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Be responsive to developer needs.</li>\n<li>Give the community a sense of shared ownership and stewardship.</li>\n<li>Be transparent about the work leading to Dart language changes.</li>\n<li>Ensure rationale for changes (or decisions not to change) is clearly communicated.</li>\n<li>Close the loop and check if stakeholders are happy before a change is finalized.</li>\n</ul>\nAnyone can create and champion a DEP, but this does not mean that Dart is a democracy. The DEP process is a key part of how we decide how Dart should evolve, but it's only one part. DEPs are managed by the DEP committee. The committee meets on a regular basis to review the proposals. Because Dart is an open Ecma specification, TC52 has final say on what changes land in the spec.<br>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",
