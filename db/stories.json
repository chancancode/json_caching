    "body": "Last year I gave in to the temptation of doing my own startup and quit my job, just like many others have done on this site.  Since then, I’ve severely changed my lifestyle and reduced my living costs to a crazy low figure and worked my ass off for the last 8 months to achieve this:\n\nwww.openloopz.com\n\nI have written more about it on Medium here: http://goo.gl/JN03yf\n\nI knew from the start the odds were stacked against me. I’m almost 36, I have a family and I live in the North East of England where - without wanting to sound negative - the opportunities are few and far between compared to what I see on here.  When I made the BETA announcement, I knew no-one would just magically sign-up, but I watched and waited anyway and became extremely pissed off when it didn’t happen. “It’s been 2 hours - why haven’t I got 100 sign-ups already?”.  Silly really.\n\nI used up all my savings to get this far and I don’t regret any of it (except maybe the weight gain, lack of a social life, and development of bad sleeping habits!). I wanted to prove to myself I can build a production quality app that I honestly believe in without bias, and I can truly say I have achieved that now.\n\nBut now comes the hard part.  I need to force myself to stop coding and start actually talking about OpenLoopz and trying to spread the word. I am the first to admit I am not very good at this. I am struggling to even write this post because I already know that probably no-one will read it.  But I just have to learn to get over that and keep going. Any feedback - good or bad - will be greatly appreciated, thanks.",
